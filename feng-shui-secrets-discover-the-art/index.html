class="post__entry u-inner"><p><span>Most people spend a significant portion of their waking hours sitting. </span><span>Depending on the scientific source,</span><span> we spend between 8.5 and even 11.5 hours per day in a sitting position.</span></p><p><span>We sit at work, in the car or on public transport, at meals and during our evening leisure activities in front of the television or reading. On average, the time spent sitting or lying down is less, which does not have a positive long-term effect on health and well-being.</span></p><p><span>This makes it all the more important to design sitting in such a way that it promotes health and well-being or at least does not have a negative impact. In addition to the diverse ergonomic aspects that scientific findings require to be taken into account, Feng Shui can also make a valuable contribution to healthy sitting. Positioning seating furniture according to Feng Shui can have a positive influence on the flow of energy and thus bring many good changes into your life. This means that even long periods of sitting can become a feel-good experience.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The living room as the energy center of the apartment</span></strong></h2><p><span>In Feng Shui, the </span><span>living room</span><span> is often referred to as the lungs of the house or apartment. Just as the lungs distribute the breath of life throughout the body, Qi also flows from the living room into all living areas.</span></p><p><span>In most households, sitting is the predominant posture in the living room. We sit comfortably on the sofa or in armchairs when we are entertained by the television, read a good book, do handicrafts or are engrossed in good conversations. Comfortable seating with a feel-good factor is therefore essential in this central room.</span></p><p><span>For most people, the sofa is the centerpiece of a cozy </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> . The positioning of this piece of furniture should therefore be done with care. The sofa also receives special attention in Feng Shui.</span></p><p><span>While the trend in modern living concepts is to position furniture primarily along the walls, according to Feng Shui, the sofa is unthinkable without a solid wall behind it.</span></p><p><span>The cozy heart of your living room should find its place with the entire backrest against a protective wall. This conveys security and security and fulfills a primal human need that goes back to our very first relatives in prehistoric times.</span></p><p><span>When people still lived in caves, it was important for their survival never to have the cave entrance behind them, but rather to entrust this unprotected side to a stable wall.</span></p><p><span>The focus was on the opening of the cave in order to be able to identify dangers early. This genetic program accompanies us to this day and also finds its place in Feng Shui. With your back against the protective wall, the view from the sofa is directed towards the doors and windows and thus conveys security and security in your personal comfort zone.</span></p><p><span>When the subconscious feels protection, the mind can calm down and is free to devote itself to creative and energetic thoughts.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting at the desk according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h2><p><span>The desk is an area in which concentration and performance, creative energy and inventiveness are of great importance in everyday life. Especially at a time when the home desk has become more of a focus in professional areas, the design of this living area should be done consciously.</span></p><p><span>In the </span><span>Feng Shui workplace,</span><span> the positioning of the desk and office chair is crucial for the flow of energy and a free mind.</span></p><p><span>Similar to the sofa, the workplace should also be positioned so that there is a stable, protective wall behind it. This conveys security and thereby releases mental capacities that can be used for creativity and creativity.</span></p><p><span>If there are windows, glass elements as doors or walls, passageways or open space at the back, this can subconsciously cause constant unrest.</span></p><p><span>The body and mind remain in a tense and alert state and can prevent creative energy from flowing freely.</span></p><p><span>It is also not helpful if the front of the desk is directly in front of a wall.</span></p><p><span>This external blockage can also block thoughts and internal energy and limit thought processes.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, a clear view across the room is stimulating. A look out of the window can tempt people who tend to dream to wander all too easily and lose focus on what is important.</span></p><p><span>Here you should listen to yourself and find out what type of thinker you are and what environment is particularly good for you.</span></p><p><span>The office chair and desk should also meet ergonomic guidelines. If physical blockages arise due to an unhealthy posture when sitting for long periods of time at work, this also affects the flow of Qi and can significantly limit the ability to concentrate and perform.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Feng Shui in the dining room: Promote the flow of energy during meals</span></strong></h2><p><span>In order to consciously enjoy a meal and support the digestive system, we should take time and sit down to eat. Whether in the dining area at home, in the canteen or in a restaurant, a mindfully designed area for meals can make a valuable contribution to well-being.</span></p><p><span>The dining area plays a central role in everyday life. This is where the family comes together to exchange ideas and lovely people meet to enjoy themselves and have lively conversations. The dining room can also be used to reflect on the day's events in order to process them and clear the mind. This energy should also be reflected in the room design.</span></p><p><span>The dining area is best placed near the center of the apartment or house. The direct proximity to the </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> or the Feng Shui living room supports the energy that flows there.</span></p><p><span>In modern living concepts, the dining room is often no longer a separate room, but is integrated into the kitchen or living room. This means that meals can benefit from the energy flow there, as long as it is used consciously.</span></p><p><span>The dining table with sufficient seating for the people living in the household and guests is the center of the dining room.</span></p><p><span>Unlike the sofa in the living room, it can also be placed in the room without requiring protective walls on all sides. At the dining table, however, it depends on where the view falls from the different seating positions.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Seating should be arranged so that people at the table can see each other without hindrance.</span></h3><p><span>This promotes communication and a feeling of connection.</span></p><p><span>High elements on the table top, such as towering plant arrangements, should therefore be avoided. The same applies to large and low-hanging lamps.</span></p><p><span>If possible, all seats should be arranged so that none of them are in the direct line between a window and a door. Looking directly at the bathroom or toilet door or the front door of the house or apartment also creates unrest and can disrupt the flow of energy.</span></p><p><span>If appropriate positioning cannot be avoided, a curtain or screen can be a flexible design aid and give the dining area its harmonious effect.</span></p><p><span>When it comes to chairs, the focus is on comfort. Nevertheless, they should not have excessive padding. A sufficiently high and wide backrest ensures seating comfort even during extended meals together and also suggests the protection and security that is achieved, for example, on a sofa by a solid wall in the back.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting on the balcony and terrace or in the garden</span></strong></h2><p><span>It's not just indoors that we spend many hours sitting. If you have a terrace, balcony or garden in your private area, you can also set up a cozy seating area there and thus create an additional living area that is close to nature and therefore particularly energetically appealing.</span></p><p><span>The rules of Feng Shui can also make an important contribution to more energy in life outdoors. The energy and Qi are channeled from the garden to the house. An </span><span>outdoor area designed according to Feng Shui</span><span> essentially determines how much energy can reach the domestic area and whether it can flow there undisturbed.</span></p><p><span>The furniture used in an outdoor seating area should reflect the natural character in terms of look and feel.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/wittekind_lounge-4er-sofa_header_01-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p><span>Wood is the preferred material that has these natural properties, does not heat up too much even in strong sunlight and can absorb and continue the energy of plants and trees. The </span><span>furniture manufacturer WITTEKIND</span><span> designs comfortable yet discreet outdoor lounge furniture made from sustainable wood that fits harmoniously into the energy flow of the Feng Shui garden.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 9, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/plants-in-the-bedroom-living-energy-source/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/16/responsive/Pflanzen-im-Schlafzimmer-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Plants in the bedroom: living energy source or oxygen competitor?" height="213" width="320"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Plants in the bedroom: living energy source or oxygen competitor?</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/8-tips-avoiding-electrosmog-from-solar-systems/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/18/responsive/Elektrosmog-durch-Solaranlagen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems" height="213" width="320"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/find-your-real-dream-apartment-according-to-feng-shui/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/7/responsive/Echte-Traumwohnung-finden_-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="According to Feng Shui, these things should be taken into account when looking for an apartment"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/find-your-real-dream-apartment-according-to-feng-shui/" class="inverse">Find your real dream apartment: According to Feng Shui, these things should be taken into account when looking for an apartment</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-28T13:00" class="u-small">April 28, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/6/responsive/ai-generated-8111336_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="437" width="640" alt="Feng Shui in the wardrobe"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="inverse">Feng Shui in the wardrobe</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-29T13:00" class="u-small">April 29, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/5/responsive/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-2-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="inverse">Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-30T13:00" class="u-small">April 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="17" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-secrets-discover-the-art/" data-page-title="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
