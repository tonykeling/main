MOBEL</a></div></div></header><div class="post__entry u-inner"><p><span>It doesn't take much effort to conjure up the magical world of Aladdin, Scheherazade and Ali Baba in your own home. Through careful planning and selecting suitable furniture, you can design your living space in an oriental style and dream of the distant lands of the Orient at any time.</span></p><p><span>Find out what is typical of the oriental look, what role Feng Shui plays in it and how you can make the dream from 1001 Nights come true. Above all, learn how you can use oriental colors to have a healing effect.</span></p><p><span>How do oriental looks and vintage furniture from India go together? Strictly speaking, “Orient” is not a geographical description. The Land of the Rising Sun, also known as the Orient, is rather culturally and religiously influenced, so that South Asian countries such as India or China can also be included. There are many similarities, especially when it comes to the teachings of Feng Shui.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>What Feng Shui has to do with well-being</span></strong></h2><p><span>Feng Shui is intended to help you find peace and strength through a harmonious environment. There are rules and tips for furnishing your home. Thanks to this, life energy can flow undisturbed, which is why you can feel really comfortable in your home. Because we know from our daily experience that every room is energetically connected to us.</span></p><p><span>Feng Shui is also known in Indian culture. The facility is intended to allow people to harmonize with their surroundings through a special design of living spaces.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_269876770-bearbeitet-1024x519.jpg" alt="Fortune cookie with saying: Time to change your life" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Living like in 1001 Nights – That's how it's done</span></strong></h2><p><span>Feng Shui doesn't just look at a furnishing style, but rather the arrangement and design of your home. This allows you to develop freely and design your home according to your personal preferences.</span></p><p><span>If you want to be particularly comfortable and immerse yourself in a world of dreams, then the oriental living style is an excellent choice. But what sets him apart?</span></p><p><span>As soon as you enter your apartment, an exotic world full of colors and magnificent decorations awaits you. This style combines comfort with a healthy dose of extravagance.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Thousands of years of tradition and modernity merge in Indian furniture style.</span></strong></h2><p><span>Vintage furniture from India is characterized by ancient Indian crafts and contemporary elements. They are often made of solid wood such as teak, acacia, mango or shisham. Real vintage furniture, which is made from recycled wood by skilled carpenters, is particularly charming. In India, new wood is scarce and expensive, so old wood is often given new life. Wooden elements from old mansions are used, such as old windows, doors, balconies and gables.</span></p><p><span>Fine carvings and numerous small details give the furniture an extravagant antique look, as is the case with furniture from </span><span>Home and Garden</span><span> . Another highlight are painted cabinets and chests of drawers, which are eye-catchers with lively colors and artistic ornaments. Do you prefer it simpler? Then the colonial style with dark wood and shiny metal fittings might suit you better.</span></p><p><span>Accessories are not only permitted in oriental and Indian furnishing styles, but are also a perfect complement to the carefully selected furniture. Poufs and seat cushions in patchwork style, sofas and armchairs with a variety of colorful, magnificently shimmering cushions made of fine brocade create a glamorous maharajah look. Canopies, carpets, curtains and printed blankets made of silk, brocade and cotton also contribute to a fairytale atmosphere.</span></p><p><span>This offers the opportunity to work with colors from Feng Shui teachings.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/feng-shui-pflanze-in-einer-vase.jpg" alt="Feng Shui plant in a white vase" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Colors in the oriental style: spiritual effects and healing powers</span></strong></h2><p><span>Yellow, the color of the earth and the sun, symbolizes the connection between heaven and earth. Yellow not only exudes coziness, but also has healing potential on a physical and mental level. This radiant color represents the power of the spirit and brightens the mood. It is often used to provide relief from problems such as rheumatism, osteoarthritis, stone formation and digestive problems.</span></p><p><span>Orange, on the other hand, stands for joy of life, inspiration, creativity and communication. It promotes the performance of the kidneys, bladder, glands and respiratory tract, increases the release of adrenaline, constricts the blood vessels, accelerates the pulse and increases the body temperature. This makes orange ideal for the oriental style.</span></p><p><span>Violet represents spirituality and meditation, and is said to stabilize damaged nerves. Violet also gives every room an oriental touch, making wooden elements and furniture appear more graceful and set accents.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Green – The longing for the Orient</span></strong></h2><p><span>Professor Dr. Ernst Pöppel, full professor of the Institute for Medical Psychology at the LMU in Munich, one of the researchers who have intensively studied the effects of colors, confirms: “It is remarkable that almost all living things have developed optical receptors whose sensitivity is in the absorption range of chlorophyll, i.e. the color of leaves. This is our evolutionary heritage and touches on the emotional memory of our ancestors. Humans have a built-in longing for green, so to speak.”</span></p><p><span>Green stabilizes and is also very important in the Orient. That's why, according to Professor Pöppel, we strive to put up houseplants, green balconies or create gardens: "We need plants in our surroundings because they connect us to the world in a very original way." They can also be used in therapy. Plants can be easily integrated, especially in the oriental style.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/farben-wirken-auf-uns-sehr.jpg" alt="A painting in different colors" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Blue – The source of energy</span></strong></h2><p><span>Blue is of great importance to humans as it is the most energetic color. Colors differ mainly in their wavelength. Blue has a wavelength of 450 nanometers and is therefore short-wave and high in energy compared to other colors. This is already used in psychiatry. Scientists have found that blue is the optimal color for depressed people who feel weak and lacking in energy. In the Orient, these colors are deliberately used to bring freshness and coolness into the room.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Red – The warming effect</span></strong></h2><p><span>Red, on the other hand, has a wavelength of 750 nanometers, making this color long-wave and low-energy. Reddish tones have a warming and calming effect on the mood.</span></p><p><span>According to Professor Pöppel, the fact that colors can trigger physical sensations, as a side effect, is possible because they work in both the conscious and unconscious parts of the brain. The information from the retina is switched in the diencephalon to the cerebral cortex, where the perceived colors are then interpreted.</span></p><p><span>The combination of oriental flair and healing colors offers the best way to strengthen health with beautiful elements.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 18, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/designing-your-own-house-according-to-feng-shui-this-is-how-it-works/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/22/responsive/Das_perfekte_Feng_Shui_Haus-320x220-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing your own house according to Feng Shui: this is how it works" height="220" width="320"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Designing your own house according to Feng Shui: this is how it works</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/pain-relief-how-feng-shui-can-help-prevent-headaches/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Pain Relief: How Feng Shui Can Help Prevent Headaches</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/24/responsive/shutterstock_672387613-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Pain Relief: How Feng Shui Can Help Prevent Headaches" height="213" width="320"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/is-feng-shui-expensive-or-are-inexpensive-furniture/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/19/responsive/Feng-Shui-kostenguenstig-3-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="213" width="320" alt="Is Feng Shui expensive or are inexpensive furniture and decorations also suitable?"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/is-feng-shui-expensive-or-are-inexpensive-furniture/" class="inverse">Is Feng Shui expensive or are inexpensive furniture and decorations also suitable?</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-12T13:00" class="u-small">May 12, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/8-tips-avoiding-electrosmog-from-solar-systems/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/18/responsive/Elektrosmog-durch-Solaranlagen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="213" width="320" alt="8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/8-tips-avoiding-electrosmog-from-solar-systems/" class="inverse">8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-11T13:00" class="u-small">May 11, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-secrets-discover-the-art/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/17/responsive/Feng-Shui-Sitzen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="213" width="320" alt="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-secrets-discover-the-art/" class="inverse">Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-10T13:00" class="u-small">May 10, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="23" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/on-trend-the-magic-of-the-orient-with-vintage-furniture-from-india/" data-page-title="On trend: The magic of the Orient with vintage furniture from India" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
