which we want to feel comfortable. They give us relaxation, give us warmth and security.</p><p>What is important is not only the furnishings of the apartment in terms of the furniture and how they coordinate with each other, but also the light, which has a major influence on the atmosphere and gives the apartment a sense of security.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feng Shui and light</strong></h2><p>The life energy Qi plays a central role in Feng Shui. Therefore, light as an energy source plays an essential role in the design of living spaces. It gives you joy of life, keeps you warm and gives your own four walls the pleasant atmosphere that is so important for your well-being.</p><p>The room should be as fully lit as possible so that the energies can flow. According to the principles of the Taoist theory of harmony, dark areas prevent the flow of Qi. Therefore, you should choose many small spots and light sources that interact harmoniously with each other.</p><blockquote><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Colorful lampshades in warm colors also accentuate neglected corners, set the mood and give the room a very special touch.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Large ceiling spotlights, on the other hand, are less suitable for lighting in the spirit of Feng Shui. They mainly irradiate the floor, are blinding and take up too much space and attention.</p><p>Here too, more subtle LED spots are the better option. The choice of lighting is essential in relation to the use of space. While you should aim for warm and soft lighting in the F eng Shui bedroom and avoid bluish light entirely, you can choose lighter colors in other rooms. In an office at home, for example, the light can be a little brighter to ensure that there is enough energy for work.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How light and seasons are related</strong></h2><p>The basic principles of Feng Shui apply all year round. Nevertheless, appropriate adjustments can be made at certain times of the year.</p><p>The darkness of winter affects many people, while summer is a period of warmth and light thanks to its brightness.</p><p>Such strong contrasts should also be reflected in the planning of your lighting. Summer is characterized by fire, whose characteristics also influence the emotional state - and are often associated with many emotions.</p><p>In summer you should therefore darken the rooms, especially in the Feng Shui bedroom, so that the energy stays outside. This ensures better sleep.</p><p>Autumn, on the other hand, is often seen in art as a motif for letting go, change and even dying. It is the time to pause.</p><p>In order to avoid an overly depressing autumn melancholy, stronger and warmer lighting helps. It not only captures the beauty of autumn, but also gives you strength.</p><p>This principle applies even more in winter, when the trees are bare and the cold is pouring in.</p><p>In spring, however, departure and something new begins. You can welcome the energy of nature, which is now gaining momentum again, back into your home. Greenish light as a symbol of blossoming invites you to start the new year.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Stunning_industrial_loft_bedroom-1024x570.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How lack of light negatively affects our health</strong></h2><p><br>Light has noticeable and measurable effects on the human body. For example, light plays a significant role in the production of vitamin D.</p><p>This circumstance means that around one in three people in Germany have too little vitamin D in their blood during the less light months of the cold season.</p><p>The further north people live, the more often this happens. One way you can prevent vitamin D deficiency is to take advantage of the few hours of sunshine and exercise outdoors as much as possible or ensure there is plenty of light.</p><p>Large windows and curtains and drapes can help to give the light a chance to penetrate the apartment.</p><p>This also promotes your sleep rhythm, which can sometimes be disrupted due to a lack of light. Daylight lamps, which prevent the process of melatonin formation, help.</p><p>Melatonin is a hormone that helps you fall asleep. Daylight lamps help you stay awake and fit during the day so that you can sleep soundly at night.</p><p>However, daylight lamps are not a replacement for bright sunlight. This is also revealed by a look at the illuminance of different light sources. Illuminance is measured in lux and shows how much light falls on a surface.</p><p>On bright summer days without a cloud in the sky, that's 100,000 lux that reaches us and even in winter when the weather is clear, the sun pampers us with up to 20,000 lux.</p><p>Even the brightest daylight lamp, which has around 6000 lux, cannot do this. Usually the brightest rooms in the home, often the office, only reach 500 lux.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Colors can determine our feelings</strong></h2><p>The influence of colors on our minds has been well documented. Blue has a communicative and stimulating effect and should therefore be used especially during the day.</p><p>Warmer colors such as orange and yellow improve our mood, while pink has a relaxing effect on our bodies.</p><p>The correct use of different colors can be crucial to how we feel in our home. At gluehbirne.de you will find the right light bulbs to create the atmosphere in your home so that you feel safe, your creativity is stimulated or you can start the day full of energy.</p><p>The color of the walls has a very significant influence on the overall picture. Bright red walls can hardly tame the flow of energy, even with subtle lighting, while gray colors can appear cool and anxious.</p><p>Here, of course, the relationship to the space is again important. So make sure you choose the right color for your wallpaper so that the right lighting can be effective. This is the only way to ensure a good flow of life energy. Since Feng Shui strives to bring all sensory experiences into harmony , you should make sure that not only the colors and brightness match each other, but that they also harmonize with the rest of your surroundings.</p><p>In addition to visual impressions, the senses of touch and hearing also influence our body and mind.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 18, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-and-chinese-medicine-to-support-hearing-loss/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/20/responsive/Hoerverlust-und-Feng-Shui-320x214-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss" height="214" width="320"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/designing-your-own-house-according-to-feng-shui-this-is-how-it-works/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Designing your own house according to Feng Shui: this is how it works</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/22/responsive/Das_perfekte_Feng_Shui_Haus-320x220-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing your own house according to Feng Shui: this is how it works" height="220" width="320"></a></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="21" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/why-light-is-a-feel-good-factor/" data-page-title="Why light is a feel-good factor" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
