people and their living environment. If you want to align your living space according to this theory, the price is not important when choosing decorations and pieces of furniture.</span></p><p><span>Look out for good offers and deals, which you can </span><span>find on My Deal,</span><span> for example . The correct alignment of decorative elements and furniture is independent of the price. We have some great savings tips for you on how to bring Feng Shui into your home and save money in the process.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Furnishing according to Feng Shui – the most important tips without high costs</span></h2><p><span>Designing your rooms according to Feng Shui doesn't cost you any money at first. By considering the basics of Chinese teachings, you are already contributing to a harmonious living environment. The perfect locations for furnishings can be calculated </span><span>using well-known Feng Shui formulas</span><span> . Regardless of the zone or room, consider the following basic tips for the perfect result:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Light is desired:</span></strong><span> In order to let life into your rooms, you need light. Keep the curtains open during the day, use light colors and combine islands of light in each room.</span></li><li><strong><span>Choose materials:</span></strong><span> To stimulate the flow of Qi, use mirrors and glasses. They are used as wind chimes, candlesticks or </span><span>decorative bowls</span><span> . For calming zones, you use wood and natural stone that fit harmoniously into the surroundings.</span></li><li><strong><span>Keep things organized:</span></strong><span> Shelves and cupboards with closed doors contribute to more structure and order. Avoid an excess of decorations, but rather rely on cleverly placed highlights.</span></li><li><strong><span>Consider the seasons:</span></strong><span> Change your accessories depending on the season. In spring, fresh flowers symbolize the arrival of new energy, in winter you can bring harmony and idyll home with a flower arrangement.</span></li><li><strong><span>Integrate plants:</span></strong><span> The free window area poses the risk of losing Qi. Place plants on the windowsill to keep Qi in the room and support Chinese teachings.</span></li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Use Feng Shui in every room - it can be done without high costs</span></h2><p><span>Feng </span><span>Shui is used in work rooms</span><span> as well as in </span><span>Feng Shui living rooms</span><span> and </span><span>Feng Shui bedrooms</span><span> . Basically, you won't incur any extra costs if you furnish your house according to the teachings of Feng Shui. We have put together some basic tips for every room that won't break your budget and still bring the art of Feng Shui into your home.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your bedroom</span></h3><p><span>Save on decorative items</span><span> in this place to keep the energy flowing. Minimalist furnishing styles are very popular; when choosing colors, pay attention to soft tones for Qi, peace and coziness. Order is crucial for the flow of Qi. Use closed cupboards and let clutter disappear.</span></p><p><span>Mirrors have no place in the bedroom because they create inner turmoil. Instead, decorate your walls with photos of your loved ones. It's not expensive and at the same time provides a pleasant feeling of coziness. Electrical devices are absolutely taboo in your bedroom. </span><span>Electrosmog affects your sleep</span><span> and imbalances the Qi.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your study</span></h3><p><span>Once you have set up your home office at home, the desk is very important. Make sure you look directly at the door when you sit at your place of work. The windows should be on the opposite side of your strong hand. If you are left-handed, the window to your right is in the right place. By working with your back to the wall, the Qi can flow optimally through the room and give you the energy you need.</span></p><p><span>Remove clocks and calendars as decorative elements from your study, as they unconsciously create pressure. Instead, rely on green plants. They give your room harmony and contribute to an optimal indoor climate. As in the living room, the center of the room should remain free. You place electrical devices against the wall, keeping the best possible distance from your desk.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-kostenguenstig-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your kitchen</span></h3><p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> is the place of regular transformations. Here you transform raw food into meals. A high flow of Qi is important, so use natural elements when furnishing. When choosing your worktop, graphite and wood are well suited as raw materials. Compare prices online and look out for discounts to save money.</span></p><p><span>If you work in the kitchen, your gaze should be towards the door if possible. The choice of dining table (if you have enough space) is very important. Round and oval tables allow for better communication strategies; the Qi intersects at square tables. The placement of the knives is particularly important. Avoid knife blocks as they pose a danger to Qi. To safely store the sharp blades, choose a closed drawer.</span></p><p><span>Water and fire are the two central elements in the kitchen and they do not harmonize with each other. Place the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher away from the stove and oven to incorporate a safe distance. Red, green, cream and white are considered suitable </span><span>colors</span><span> for the kitchen. Natural elements such as stone and wood fit very well.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your living room</span></h3><p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> is the perfect place for mirrors. This expands your view and ensures an optical increase in size. To save money, buy your mirrors second hand or browse a flea market. Maybe your neighbors, friends or grandparents also have decorative mirrors in the basement that they would like to pass on to you for a small amount of money.</span></p><p><span>To prevent Qi blockages, keep doors open in the living room. If you want to integrate a privacy screen, airy and loose curtains are suitable for the door frames. The most important rules also include a free middle. Avoid furniture in the middle of the room, otherwise the Qi cannot flow into all corners of the room.</span></p><p><span>To create a warm atmosphere at the same time, cover the floor in the middle of the room with light, warm carpets. Look for bargains and special offers to save your budget.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Feng Shui doesn’t have to be expensive – buy your furnishings cheaply!</span></h2><p><span>The teachings of Feng Shui do not dictate how expensive your furniture and decorations have to be. Instead, it is primarily about the type of furnishings, the use of appropriate colors and the placement of furniture.</span></p><p><span>Theoretically, you can set up an apartment suitable for Feng Shui using your existing furniture. You may just need to replace individual elements. Closed cupboards are better than open shelves, round coffee and dining tables promote communication.</span></p><p><span>In the age of the Internet, you have many opportunities to save money when buying furniture. Take advantage of deals, offers and discounts so you spend less money on your facility. Also compare prices, because not every dealer is actually cheaper. To live according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> , you don't need a lot of money. What is more important is the willingness to rearrange your rooms and thus ensure optimal Qi flow.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 9, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/8-tips-avoiding-electrosmog-from-solar-systems/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/18/responsive/Elektrosmog-durch-Solaranlagen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems" height="213" width="320"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-and-chinese-medicine-to-support-hearing-loss/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/20/responsive/Hoerverlust-und-Feng-Shui-320x214-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss" height="214" width="320"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-and-chinese-medicine-to-support-hearing-loss/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/20/responsive/Hoerverlust-und-Feng-Shui-320x214-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="214" width="320" alt="Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-and-chinese-medicine-to-support-hearing-loss/" class="inverse">Harmony for the senses: Feng Shui and Chinese medicine to support hearing loss</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-13T13:00" class="u-small">May 13, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/6/responsive/ai-generated-8111336_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="437" width="640" alt="Feng Shui in the wardrobe"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="inverse">Feng Shui in the wardrobe</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-29T13:00" class="u-small">April 29, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/5/responsive/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-2-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="inverse">Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-30T13:00" class="u-small">April 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="19" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/is-feng-shui-expensive-or-are-inexpensive-furniture/" data-page-title="Is Feng Shui expensive or are inexpensive furniture and decorations also suitable?" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
