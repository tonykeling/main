class="post__entry u-inner"><p><span>Plants play an important role in Feng Shui. Ultimately, in practice, Feng Shui aims to promote harmonious energies in rooms. Plants have also been proven to improve air quality and thus ensure greater well-being.</span></p><p><span>Plants in the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> are a special case . As already explained, humans and plants compete to a certain extent for oxygen at night. During the day, plants carry out photosynthesis. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.</span></p><p><span>This process is driven by daylight. Without light, this photosynthesis cannot take place. Instead, plants absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night. This process is called cellular respiration, an exchange of gases that occurs at a much lower rate than photosynthesis during the day.</span></p><p><span>In a normally ventilated room where plants are located, there is no risk of people and plants competing for oxygen. So there is no reason to ban plants from the bedroom. On the contrary. In </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> plants are also viewed as living sources of energy, which not least have a symbolic meaning for growth and harmony. They help attract and spread positive Qi energies.</span></p><p> </p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>About colors and shapes of flower pots</span></strong></h2><p><span>We have already talked about the selection of plants. But it's not just the plant itself that matters, but also the material and color of the flower pots and their placement in the bedroom. With a </span><span>flower pot from pflanzenwerk.de,</span><span> every plant can be optimally showcased.</span></p><p><span>The </span><span>color</span><span> of the flower pots can have a decisive influence on the energetic balance in the room. Terracotta, brown and yellow represent the earth element and create a warm atmosphere. These colors are well suited for rooms or areas that require calm and stability.</span></p><p><span>Green tones give a room a lively atmosphere and should be chosen carefully for the bedroom. This also applies to white, silver or metallic colors.</span></p><p><span>Blue and black, on the other hand, represent the water element in Feng Shui and can </span><span>bring a calming, flowing energy into the room</span><span> . Flower pots in these colors are ideal for rooms that are intended to promote relaxation and recovery.</span></p><p><span>The shapes of flower pots also have an energetic impact on the room. Round and oval flower pots create a calm, relaxed atmosphere. They are often used in the bedroom to support positive energy and create a pleasant environment.</span></p><p><span>The size of the flower pots is also important. If the pots are too small or too large in relation to the surrounding area, they can affect the energetic balance. Therefore, the size of the flower pots should be based on the size of the room and not have a dominating effect.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The right locations</span></strong></h2><p><span>In order to create a harmonious environment, the placement of the flower pots in the bedroom is also important. Sharp corners or pointed edges should always be avoided near the bed to prevent negative energy.</span></p><p><span>The room must be well ventilated to allow positive circulation of Qi, the vital life energy, in </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . Effective ventilation not only promotes the free flow of Qi, but also supports a harmonious distribution of energy throughout the room.</span></p><p><span>In classical Feng Shui, specific areas of a room are considered according to the cardinal directions, with the placement of flower pots and other decorative elements strategically chosen to promote the balance of the five elements. This helps create a positive atmosphere and strengthens the energetic balance in the room.</span></p><p><span>Feng Shui emphasizes that any object, including a flower pot, has an energetic influence on the space. It is recommended that these items should be kept in perfect condition.</span></p><p><span>An intact and well-loved flower pot not only enhances the aesthetic beauty of the room, but also contributes positively to the energy quality. In the spirit of Feng Shui, the condition and care of each individual object is viewed as a reflection of the soul. It is therefore advisable to handle the objects consciously, to care for them and to care for them in order to create a positive and supportive atmosphere.</span></p><p> </p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>It's all about caring for the plants</span></strong></h2><p><span>Of course, proper care of the plants is also crucial for well-being and the atmosphere in the bedroom. To do this, you need to understand the needs of the respective plant species. Every plant has different requirements for light, water and nutrients.</span></p><p><span>Some plants need a lot of sunlight, others are happy with less. The plants I suggested, jasmine, ivy, lucky feather and money tree, tolerate a wide variety of lighting conditions and also feel quite comfortable in shady locations. The optimal temperature is 18 degrees, which is just right for the bedroom.</span></p><p><span>These plants do not like direct sunlight, and they have something else in common: they </span><span>cannot tolerate waterlogging</span><span> . That's why you should water the plants in the bedroom regularly, but not excessively, and remove excess water from the planters. To promote the health of the plant, it is also important to always remove dead leaves immediately and occasionally shorten the plant slightly so that it does not grow excessively.</span></p><p><span>Careful care of your plants is particularly important in the bedroom because they are intended to provide a calming backdrop. Just the sight of well-cared for plants can reduce stress and improve your mood. Therefore, pay regular attention to the plants. Then they not only represent a decorative element, but also support a restful and harmonious night's sleep.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How many plants should there be?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As I said, you should use plants sparingly in the bedroom. But how many plants are actually necessary to have a positive effect on the indoor climate? In fact, studies have shown that just a few plants can improve indoor air quality. Experts recommend placing at least one plant per 10 square meters of room space.</span></p><p><span>Among the particularly effective plants is the ivy. It is known for its ability to absorb airborne pollutants emitted from furniture, paint, carpets and other items.</span></p><p><span>As a very robust plant, it adapts well to all indoor conditions and is therefore also suitable for people with less green thumbs.</span></p><p><span>It is important, however, that plants are not the only solution for good air quality. Regular ventilation and reducing sources of air pollutants also play a role. Nevertheless, plants can make a positive contribution and promote a healthy, pleasant environment. Last but not least, they are a natural and cost-effective method of optimizing the indoor climate.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 9, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-furniture-with-the-right-dimensions/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/2/responsive/da-guojing-6888603_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui furniture with the right dimensions" height="427" width="640"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Feng Shui furniture with the right dimensions</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-secrets-discover-the-art/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/17/responsive/Feng-Shui-Sitzen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!" height="213" width="320"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/5/responsive/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-2-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui/" class="inverse">Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-30T13:00" class="u-small">April 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="16" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/plants-in-the-bedroom-living-energy-source/" data-page-title="Plants in the bedroom: living energy source or oxygen competitor?" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
