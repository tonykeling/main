topic that is becoming increasingly important in society. It therefore does not ignore people who want to furnish their rooms according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> or have already furnished them. The question for them is how Feng Shui and sustainability aspects can be reconciled. A common consideration is investing in a solar system, as this brings with it numerous advantages. However, </span><span>negative effects such as electrosmog</span><span> are often feared. It is therefore worth taking a closer look at the topic so that you can make the best decision for your individual case.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How are Feng Shui and sustainability related?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Feng Shui plays an important role for more and more people when they build a house or furnish their apartment. Nevertheless, they also have to take other aspects into account, for example legal requirements, financial aspects or sustainability.</span></p><p><span>Solar systems are becoming increasingly popular as a way to make a valuable contribution to the fight against climate change and to become independent of network operators and rising costs. There are not only financial arguments in favor of a photovoltaic system on the roof, but also financial ones.</span></p><p><span>Modern systems can now be installed on a variety of different roofs, which is why it is definitely worth getting professional advice, clarifying the individual options and </span><span>realistically calculating</span><span> the costs for the solar system . The only question that remains is whether and to what extent such a PV system on the roof also affects Feng Shui, even though it is not really visible or noticeable inside the house?</span></p><p><span>In fact, Feng Shui and sustainability are closely related, so that an influence of the solar system on the interior of the rooms or the well-being in them cannot be ruled out with certainty.</span></p><p><span>Ultimately, Feng Shui is about the flow of energy, which can be promoted through natural design but can also be disrupted by influences such as electrosmog. It is also recommended to choose elements that are as natural as possible, which a solar system cannot achieve, at least at the moment.</span></p><p><span>However, it corresponds to another Feng Shui principle: a sustainable environment has a positive effect on mental and physical health. A design according to Feng Shui and a solar system on the roof can therefore complement each other perfectly, but the combination also brings with it some stumbling blocks that need to be known and taken into account.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Electrosmog from solar systems – is the fear justified?</span></strong></h2><p><span>At best, a solar system should not disrupt the appearance and functionality of your own four walls. Since it is located outside the field of vision, this is usually not a problem indoors. This aspect needs to be given more consideration when designing outdoor areas. But according to Feng Shui, a photovoltaic system can also cause disruptions inside, namely </span><span>through potential electrosmog</span><span> .</span></p><p><span>In principle, solar panels have no negative impact on well-being or the flow of energy in your own home, as they fit harmoniously into the roof.</span></p><p><span>There are always discussions only with regard to electric fields. In order to realistically evaluate this influence, it is worth finding out about the technology in the PV modules: The electricity is generated in the form of direct current, i.e. a magnetic constant field is created, which causes significantly fewer problems with regard to electrosmog than a direct current Alternating field.</span></p><p><span>In addition, electricity production does not take place permanently, but only when there is sufficient sunlight and therefore only during the day. There is therefore no need to worry about sleep disorders caused by electrosmog caused by a PV generator.</span></p><p><span>Other influences include the size of the system, the extent of electricity production and the types of inverters.</span></p><p><span>The bottom line is that the problem with electrosmog in solar systems is significantly smaller than is often assumed. However, the fear is not completely unfounded, because sooner or later the direct current generated must of course be converted into grid-compliant alternating current and this happens in the so-called inverter. This can lead to the already mentioned, more critical alternating magnetic fields, regardless of the time of day or night.</span></p><blockquote><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><span>Grounding the module field is then the most effective and at the same time simplest solution.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Elektrosmog-durch-Solaranlagen--1024x573.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Pay attention to earth radiation</span></h2><p><mark class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><span>Systems on residential building roofs should only be considered in conjunction with so-called earth radiation shielding, as otherwise considerable additional stress can arise from reflections. Both photovoltaic and solar systems as well as thermal insulation in the roof, which consist of glass wool with aluminum foil, cause large-scale radiation reflections due to their metallized surfaces. This leads to increased radiation exposure in the rooms on the upper floor. These reflections can only be avoided by using a shielding coating, for example in the basement or on the floor.</span></mark></p><p><strong><span>Make sure there is enough space between the modules and rooms used during the day.</span></strong></p><div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><p><span>Grounding the modules is essential.</span></p><p><span>Avoid the formation of large conductor loops.</span></p><p><span>Use shielded, grounded string lines or place them in grounded pipes.</span></p><p><span>Position the inverter as far away as possible from permanent places such as your bed or your office workstation.</span></p></div></div><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Tips to avoid electrosmog caused by photovoltaics</span></strong></h2><p><span>The fact is that solar systems can create electrosmog, just like all other electronic devices in your home. However, this danger is much smaller than is often assumed and there are simple solutions to minimize electrosmog or – better yet – completely prevent it. Here are some helpful tips so that you don't have to miss out on the advantages of a photovoltaic system, but can still furnish your home according to Feng Shui and protect it from electrosmog:</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>1. </span><strong><span>Ground the module field.</span></strong></h3><p><span>As you already know, it makes sense to ground the module field of the solar system in order to minimize or completely eliminate electrosmog. It is worth speaking to an experienced expert about this in order to integrate the PV system into your own home right from the start so that it does not become an energy disruptive factor. Such grounding or dissipation may also be useful for other components to minimize electromagnetic interference and ensure that it is dissipated properly.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>2. </span><strong><span>Separate the PV generator and the living spaces.</span></strong></h3><p><span>It also makes sense to install the generator as far as possible from the rooms where you spend the most time. The more distance possible, the better. If in doubt, it is better to position it near the rooms in which you stay at night rather than those that are your main place of residence during the day - since the solar system does not work at night.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>3. </span><strong><span>Avoid conductor loops if possible.</span></strong></h3><p><span>Conductor loops are also</span><span> a common cause of electrosmog from electronic devices . They should therefore only be used in the smallest possible number and in the smallest possible size, for example as lightning protection for the solar system.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>4. </span><strong><span>Make sure there is good shielding.</span></strong></h3><p><span>If the distance between the solar system and the living room or bedroom is too short so that you fear energy disruptions caused by electrosmog, additional shielding may make sense. There are special shielding materials and colors available that can help reduce electrosmog. So find out whether these paints and materials are available and useful in your individual case to block potential electromagnetic radiation.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>5. </span><strong><span>Invest in special cabling.</span></strong></h3><p><span>Shielding also makes sense for the cabling, as this often has points of contact with the living spaces and is therefore also a potential source of electrosmog. The cables and technology should therefore be shielded with suitable materials, which is why professional advice is worthwhile before laying.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>6. </span><strong><span>Take regular EMF measurements.</span></strong></h3><p><span>If you are still unsure whether the solar system and its components are causing electrosmog in your home, </span><span>regular EMF measurements</span><span> are a good idea . Special EMF measuring devices help monitor exposure to electromagnetic fields and take countermeasures if necessary. Furthermore, an electrical installation specialist or a special EMF expert can provide a professional assessment of the situation and help prevent electrosmog from the solar system.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>7. </span><strong><span>Combat electrosmog through frequency management.</span></strong></h3><p><span>Combating electrosmog with electronic devices doesn't sound very effective at first glance. However, there are now special technologies that control radio frequencies and can thereby minimize electromagnetic pollution. It is therefore worthwhile to at least inform yourself about the options and check to what extent their use in your four walls makes sense.</span></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>8. </span><strong><span>The solar system should be checked regularly.</span></strong></h3><p><span>Finally, it can happen that electrosmog only arises over time when the solar system is damaged, the shielding materials become brittle or malfunctions occur. Regular inspection and maintenance of the PV system is therefore essential - these are often already included in the services of the provider who also carries out the installation.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong></h2><p><span>In summary, there is nothing wrong with installing a solar system on the roof if you have designed your apartment or house according to Feng Shui. However, it is important to inform yourself about the special features described and to take appropriate measures to prevent or minimize electrosmog. Then you can make optimal use of the advantages of your own PV system without having to worry about energy or other disadvantages - for a life in harmony with Feng Shui and sustainability.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 9, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-secrets-discover-the-art/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/17/responsive/Feng-Shui-Sitzen-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!" height="213" width="320"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/is-feng-shui-expensive-or-are-inexpensive-furniture/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Is Feng Shui expensive or are inexpensive furniture and decorations also suitable?</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/19/responsive/Feng-Shui-kostenguenstig-3-320x213-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Is Feng Shui expensive or are inexpensive furniture and decorations also suitable?" height="213" width="320"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-mirror-tips-and-tricks/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/37/responsive/A-simple-slim-brass-blue-circle-frame-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="2048" width="2048" alt="Feng Shui Mirror: Tips and Tricks"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-mirror-tips-and-tricks/" class="inverse">Feng Shui Mirror: Tips and Tricks</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-30T13:00" class="u-small">May 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/how-you-can-reduce-electrosmog-in-your-home/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/25/responsive/mietwohnung-mit-feng-shui-einrichten-wohnzimmer-320x213-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="213" width="320" alt="How you can reduce electrosmog in your home"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/how-you-can-reduce-electrosmog-in-your-home/" class="inverse">How you can reduce electrosmog in your home</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-18T13:00" class="u-small">May 18, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/on-trend-the-magic-of-the-orient-with-vintage-furniture-from-india/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/23/responsive/Vintage-Moebeln-aus-Indien-320x214-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="214" width="320" alt="On trend: The magic of the Orient with vintage furniture from India"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/on-trend-the-magic-of-the-orient-with-vintage-furniture-from-india/" class="inverse">On trend: The magic of the Orient with vintage furniture from India</a></h4><time datetime="2024-05-16T13:00" class="u-small">May 16, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="18" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/8-tips-avoiding-electrosmog-from-solar-systems/" data-page-title="8 Tips Avoiding Electrosmog From Solar Systems" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
