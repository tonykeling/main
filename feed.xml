                <p><span>Radiation and electrosmog arise in your own four walls in two ways: electrically and magnetically.</span></p>
<p><span>Electric fields arise in the house where there is a measurable voltage. Magnetic fields only become active when current flows.</span></p>
<p><span>To put it simply, radiation is created when the light switch is pressed or the household appliance is turned on.</span></p>

<h4 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default"><span>The following article will explain which household appliance is the biggest smog offender at home and how consumers can protect themselves from electrosmog in their own home.</span></h4>

<div class="elementor-widget-container">
<p><span>When it comes to electrosmog at home, it is not possible to spontaneously identify a culprit because there is a variety of data that must be available in order to identify which device is causing electrosmog at home.</span></p>
<p><span>Transformers and electric motors are crucial because they can generate magnetic fields even at low current levels. </span></p>
<p><span>Radiation exposure can be measured using broadband measuring devices. If you want to use this to initially find out the radiation exposure in the house or on certain devices, you will probably find out that the magnetic field increases with the strength of the current. Even more complex technologies, such as those installed in a dimmer, can lead to higher levels of electrosmog.</span></p>
<p><span>It makes sense to examine radiation exposure in your own home at the latest when health consequences are already foreseeable. </span></p>
<p><span>So anyone who constantly suffers from headaches, is tired, </span><span>doesn't sleep well</span><span> and shows other non-specific symptoms of this kind could check how high their radiation exposure really is at home.</span></p>

<div class="elementor-widget-container">
<p><span>Since the radiation itself is invisible and Wi-Fi and smartphones are not the only sources of electrosmog, a surprise could arise with seemingly harmless devices. Multiple sockets, smart TVs, baby monitors and clock radios could also cause electrosmog at home</span></p>

<p><span>There are a number of measures that can help reduce radiation exposure at home. </span></p>
<p><span>This starts with renting or buying a place to stay. If the high-voltage line is far away, the radiation exposure is lower. Anyone who moves in should have the electrical installation carried out by a specialist who can lay cables in a low-radiation manner and may even recommend a mains isolator. </span></p>
<p><span>In everyday life, electrosmog can be reduced by switching off unused devices. When using a smartphone, the following also applies: only make calls if the reception is good and the radiation is therefore low. </span></p>
<p><span>A headset reduces direct strain on the head. If you don't need them, you should deactivate updates that run continuously in the background or only use them for longer periods of time. This reduces radiation exposure.</span></p>

<p><span>There are other sensible purchases in the </span><span>online shop for electrosmog shielding</span><span> , which can often reduce the harmful radiation in a particularly nice way. </span></p>
<p><span>With a special canopy over the bed, radiation can be shielded in the bedroom, for example. Special curtains can also actively help keep the invisible rays away from the people in the room. </span></p>
<p><span>Using shielding paint on the walls can reduce high-frequency electromagnetic radiation throughout an entire room.</span></p>
<p><span>I also strongly recommend that you carry out a measurement in advance with a subject matter expert who can take appropriate measurements. If you need assistance finding an expert, I will be happy to help.</span></p>
<p><span>Clothing - from T-shirts, shirts, boxer shorts and pajamas to hoodies, shorts and scarves to headscarves, caps and hats - is also offered to reduce radiation exposure. However, you should be careful if you wear protective clothing, the high-frequency radiation can be reflected in your body many times, for example under your shirt. Clothing can only be recommended in very specific cases, e.g. B. in X-ray diagnostics.</span></p>

<p><span>The combination of these measures to reduce radiation and these Feng Shui tips for a </span><span>happier home</span><span> can sustainably optimize well-being in the home.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>For example, following the teachings of Feng Shui, the entrance area should be designed to be open and accessible. Creaking doors disrupt the atmosphere, as does the radiation emitted by a smart home system, for example.</span></li>
<li><span>In the center of the house, usually in the living area, attention should be paid to delicate furnishings that allow the energy to circulate. Although very few living areas are free of technology, it helps to interrupt the flow of electricity when it is not being used. By the way, fresh flowers and order, which shows attentiveness, are much nicer to look at than a black television.</span></li>
<li><span>In the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> and in the </span><span>Feng Shui children's room,</span><span> electrical appliances are taboo according to the teachings of Feng Shui and with regard to radiation exposure. Mirrors should also not be hung in the bedroom, as they bring turmoil into the room instead of enabling restful sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>The kitchen is ideally sized to accommodate a dining table. Small feasts can be enjoyed here as a family – ideally with fresh food that adds color and freshness to the table. If the kitchen is designed so that the stove is placed right next to the sink, a bamboo plant will help reduce the conflict between fire and water.</span></li>
<li><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> is also responsible for family gatherings and relaxing in the evening. Bright and light colors often have a relaxing effect or beautiful </span><span>Feng Shui decoration</span><span> brings balance to your professional life.</span></li>

<p><span>According to various statements, if  the radiation remains below the limit values ​​set by </span><span>the Federal Office for Radiation Protection , there is no immediate health risk.</span></p>
<p><span>However, it remains confirmed that electrosmog can have an impact on the body. In a healthy body, radiation can cause the body to heat up. </span></p>
<p><span>However, the radiation could have negative effects on a pacemaker. The limits were first formulated in 1997 and leveled in 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>The aim is to reduce the heat load on the body so that no health-relevant disadvantages result. There is, however, a restriction because this regulation only applies to so-called fixed systems, i.e. radio systems owned by private individuals, radar systems and radio stations. However, everyone has to protect themselves from electrosmog in their own four walls.</span></p>

<p><span>The  </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span>  is the place in the home where family members and friends meet and is therefore a good place to place the television.

<p><span>Order and harmonious  </span><span>Feng Shui decoration</span><span>  are an essential part of  </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span>  and therefore the television as such should not immediately attract all the attention. So understatement is required here.</span></p>
<p><span>An ideal solution could be to attach the  </span><span>electronics</span><span> , which today are only a few centimeters deep,   directly to the wall or to a wooden panel using a </span><span>wall mount for televisions .</span></p>
<p><span>The second solution also ensures that the cables disappear behind the wood, thus ensuring order again.  </span><u><span>How all the elements can be reconciled</span></u><span> can best   be determined in a </span><span>Feng Shui consultation .</span></p>

<p><span>Electrical appliances have   no place in the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> . Electrosmog is the number one calm killer and stress trigger.

<p><span>If you don't want to be without your cell phone next to your pillow because the alarm clock is supposed to go off the next morning, it's best to switch to airplane mode to limit the radiation.</span></p>
<p><span>For other electrical devices, you can start by using a power strip that can be switched off separately. When it comes to the power strip, however, it is important to ensure that it itself should be used in a shielded form.</span></p>
<p><span>Ideally, there are no electrical appliances in the bedroom according to Feng Shui.</span></p>
<p><span>The power lines in the wall, which you cannot escape, can be stopped using a mains circuit breaker. You should definitely ask a specialist for advice here.</span></p>
<p><span>Waterbeds are another disruptive factor for restful sleep. Not only does the electricity disturb the body, the heating pipes in particular generate electrical fields. Since we cannot exclude electric fields in our environment, it is always advisable to choose a bed and </span><span> mattress</span><span>  that does not contain any metal parts. Because metal, like water, conducts electric fields.</span></p>

<p><span>According to scientists, the blood-brain barrier is broken after just a few minutes of using a cell phone. This can lead to the destruction of nerve cells, especially since proteins and toxins can penetrate. In experiments with chicken eggs, increased genetic damage was found with permanent high-frequency radiation.</span></p>
<p><span>Since we all like to use our smartphones, it is particularly advisable to keep a distance of 2 m from your body when making calls.</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that headphones that are not shielded transmit these fields directly into your ear.</span></p>
<p><span>The same applies to the laptop, because we associate it with work and so we literally take it to bed with us. At some point you may be able to do without the television.  </span><span>What sleep researchers have discovered</span><span> is that the body can be conditioned. If you use the </span><span>bedroom</span><span> exclusively for sleeping over a certain period of time   , problems falling asleep and staying asleep are reduced.</span></p>

<p><span>Shielding from electrosmog is not always possible. Plus, there are a lot of products on the market that just don't work. This is where Qi technology comes into play, which can have a supportive and harmonizing effect thanks to natural light frequencies. It helps to reduce your personal electromagnetic fields and thus balance the influence of unnatural frequencies on your body.</span></p>
<p><span>The devices use a special liquid to transform the artificial radiation from cell phones, WiFi and Bluetooth back into natural radiation.</span></p>
<p><span>The effect of the devices arises from a physical principle of action, depolarization.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What is depolarization?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To put it simply: depolarization means that focused and polarized artificial radiation is converted into a more natural state. Natural radiation is flat and unpolarized, which means it has no direction of rotation. The depolarization is made possible by the specially developed liquid, Qi-Liquid.</span></p>
<p><span>Imagine it like a very thin laser beam hitting the liquid. The liquid transforms this beam and a gentle light emerges from the liquid. Simply put, the liquid does the opposite of what a magnifying glass would do.</span></p>
<p><span>By converting the radiation, the field strength in the electromagnetic field is reduced. This means that a more natural environment is created to ensure radiation protection.</span></p>
<p><span>This means you can take advantage of the latest technology without worry, while giving yourself and your loved ones a protected home.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The basics of Feng Shui</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Feng Shui is a </span><strong><span>traditional Chinese art</span></strong><span> that has been practiced for thousands of years to create harmony between people and their surroundings. The name Feng Shui literally translates to </span><strong><span>“wind and water</span></strong><span> ,” and these two elements symbolize the </span><strong><span>flow of energy</span></strong><span> , or </span><strong><span>Qi,</span></strong><span> through our surroundings. It is the art of designing our environment to optimize the <strong>flow of </strong></span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> to promote prosperity, health and harmony. A harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> can also help to relieve or prevent ailments such as </span><span>tension headaches. The fundamentals of Feng Shui are deeply rooted in </span><strong><span>Chinese philosophy</span></strong><span> and the observation of nature. Here are some key concepts you should know:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>The concept of Qi: </span></strong><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> is the </span><strong><span>life-giving energy</span></strong><span> that flows through everything. A harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> in your </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> or at work can contribute to improved general well-being.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>The Five Elements:</span></strong><span> Feng Shui is based on the theory of the </span><strong><span>five elements</span></strong><span> – wood, fire, earth, metal and water. The balance and interaction of these elements in your environment influences the </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> and thus your well-being.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Yin and Yang:</span></strong><span> The </span><strong><span>balance of Yin and Yang</span></strong><span> , the opposing and complementary forces, is crucial to creating a harmonious environment.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>The Bagua Card:</span></strong><span> The </span><strong><span>Bagua Card</span></strong><span> is a fundamental tool in Feng Shui and helps identify different areas of life and their connection to different parts of your living or working space.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span>Compass school or form school:</span></strong><span> Feng Shui practices can be divided into </span><strong><span>compass schools</span></strong><span> , which focus on directional energies and time qualities, and </span><strong><span>form schools</span></strong><span> , which focus on the physical design and arrangement of spaces. Both systems should be used in good </span><span>Feng Shui advice .</span></p>
<p><span>By applying these basics, you can begin to understand and optimize the </span><strong><span>energy flows</span></strong><span> in your environment. Feng Shui offers a rich range of tools and techniques to improve the quality of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> in your living space, creating a </span><strong><span>harmonious and supportive environment</span></strong><span> . Any change, no matter how small, can be a significant step in promoting balance and positive energy in your daily life. The art of Feng Shui can create a deeper connection between you and your living space, which lays the foundation for a </span><strong><span>balanced and healthy life</span></strong><span> .</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Feng Shui to prevent headaches</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The traditional art of Feng Shui offers a range of tools and techniques that can help you create a </span><strong><span>harmonious environment that promotes </span></strong><strong><span>well-being</span></strong><span> . This harmony can have a positive effect on </span><strong><span>preventing headaches</span></strong><span> .</span></p>
<p><span>By consciously designing your living and work spaces, you can create a supportive space that can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. In the following sections, I will discuss the key aspects of </span><strong><span>room design</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>color therapy</span></strong><span> in Feng Shui and their potential impact on headaches.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Spatial design and flow of Qi</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Interior </span><strong><span>design</span></strong><span> plays a central role in the practice of Feng Shui, and the goal is to promote life energy. A steady and harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> can help promote overall well-being and possibly prevent headaches. The </span><strong><span>arrangement of furniture</span></strong><span> , the selection of beautiful </span><span>Feng Shui </span><strong><span>decorations</span></strong> <span>and the general organization of the room can influence you.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><strong><span>clarity and order</span></strong><span> in a room can help reduce </span><strong><span>stress</span></strong><span> and therefore the likelihood of headaches. A neat and clearly designed space allows for an unobstructed flow </span><strong><span>of Qi</span></strong><span> , creating a relaxing and supportive environment. It is also advisable to avoid </span><strong><span>blockages and clutter as these can inhibit the flow of energy and cause stress.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Another important consideration is the </span><strong><span>positioning</span></strong><span> of furniture and other objects in a room. Avoiding sharp edges and creating open spaces can also help. The </span><strong><span>direction</span></strong><span> in which furniture faces or is aligned is also important. Harmonious room design can help prevent headaches and create a calming environment.</span></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Color therapy and its potential effect on headaches</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong><span>Colors</span></strong><span> have a special meaning in Feng Shui and can influence the energy of a room. They can alsoaffect</span><strong><span> emotions</span></strong><span> and</span><strong><span> overall well-being , providing a potential solution to </span></strong><strong><span>headache prevention</span></strong><span> .</span></p>
<p><span>Choosing calming colors can have a relaxing effect and help create a stress-free environment.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing calming colors can have a relaxing effect and help create a stress-free environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span>For example, blue</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>green</span></strong><span> are colors associated with calm and healing. They can help create a relaxing and calming atmosphere, potentially reducing the frequency of headaches.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>On the other hand, bright colors</span></strong><span> such as intense red or orange can in some cases be perceived as stimulating or even annoying and therefore do not help relieve headaches.</span></p>
<p><span>Using </span><strong><span>color therapy</span></strong><span> in Feng Shui is an individual journey. It is important to choose colors that give you a feeling of calm and balance. By experimenting with different colors and observing how they affect your mood and well-being, you can find a color palette that helps prevent headaches and creates a harmonious environment.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Steps to optimize living and working areas</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Optimizing spaces is a central element of Feng Shui and can help create a harmonious and healthy environment </span><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> Such an environment can, in turn, help relieve or prevent headaches and other ailments. Here are some concrete steps you can take to optimize chi flow in your living and work spaces:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Tidying up and decluttering:</span></strong><span> Start by clearing your rooms of clutter. Clutter can block and cause stress. A tidy, well-organized space allows for a free and harmonious flow of energy.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Furniture positioning:</span></strong><span> Position your furniture so that it supports you and doesn't block you. Avoid placing furniture directly in front of doors or in narrow passageways. The </span><strong><span>positioning of the furniture</span></strong><span> should also promote communication and interaction between people. A </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span><span> in particular should be individually designed for your child in order to strengthen their health.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Using Plants:</span></strong><span> Live plants can help enliven the space and improve air quality. Choose plants with rounded leaves and avoid plants with pointed or spiky leaves, as these are considered negative energy.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Influence of colors:</span></strong><span> As already mentioned in color therapy, colors can influence the energy of a room. Use calming colors to create a relaxing and harmonious environment.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Use of mirrors: </span></strong><span>Mirrors</span><span> can visually enlarge rooms. However, place them so that they don't reflect sharp edges or unpleasant views.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Pay attention to good lighting:</span></strong><span> Good lighting is crucial for a positive energy flow. Use natural light sources wherever possible and complement them with warm artificial lighting to brighten dark corners.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Establish quiet zones:</span></strong><span> Create areas where you can </span><span>relax and unwind</span><span> . Quiet zones help to calm you down and offer you a place to relax.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Regular ventilation:</span></strong><span> Fresh air is important for your lungs and your vitality. Ventilate your rooms regularly to improve air quality and avoid stagnant energy.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Using Feng Shui Treatments</span></strong><span> : You can also use specific Feng Shui treatments such as crystals, water features, or wind chimes to optimize space and promote balance and harmony in your rooms. This often requires the professional expertise of a </span><span>Feng Shui consultant</span><span> .</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>By following these steps, you can make a big contribution to </span><strong><span>optimizing</span></strong><span> your living and working areas. Not only will this improve the quality of your environment, but it can also help reduce the frequency and severity of headaches by creating a supportive and relaxing environment.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Other natural methods for pain relief</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In addition to optimizing the flow of chi through Feng Shui, there are other </span><strong><span>natural methods</span></strong><span> that can help </span><strong><span>relieve pain</span></strong><span> . These methods can be a useful addition to promote a harmonious balance between body and mind and thus improve the quality of life. Some additional approaches as well as the importance of a holistic approach to pain relief are discussed below.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Complementary approaches such as acupuncture, meditation and yoga</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong><span>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that is intended to activate the body's </span></strong><span>self-healing powers</span><span> and restore energetic balance by inserting needles into specific points on the body . It can be helpful for various pain conditions, including headaches, and is often recommended as a safe method of pain relief.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Meditation</span></strong><span> is a practice that aims to calm the mind and increase awareness. Through regular meditation, you can learn to better deal with stress, which can be a major cause of tension headaches. Meditation can also help you develop a deeper awareness of your body's signals and thus respond better to pain.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Yoga</span></strong><span> is another complementary method that involves both the body and the mind. Combining physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation can help relieve muscle tension, improve flexibility, and promote an overall sense of well-being. Yoga can be particularly helpful for relieving tension that can cause headaches.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Familie-1024x682.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The importance of a holistic approach to pain relief</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>A </span><strong><span>holistic approach</span></strong><span> to pain relief recognizes that the body and mind are connected and that healing must begin on different levels. By combining Feng Shui with other natural healing methods, you can take a more comprehensive approach to pain relief and promoting overall well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>Integrating various </span><strong><span>natural healing methods</span></strong><span> can provide an effective strategy for managing and preventing pain.</span></p>
<p><span>It's about creating a supportive environment while learning tools to help you better deal with pain and stress.</span></p>
<p><span>Promoting a </span><strong><span>harmonious lifestyle</span></strong><span> through the application of Feng Shui principles, coupled with regular practice of yoga, meditation and possibly acupuncture, can be a powerful method to promote overall well-being and support natural pain relief. By looking at the bigger picture and adopting a holistic approach, you can find a positive path to pain relief and a better quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Conclusion: Harmony as the key to headache relief</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Throughout this article, we have explored the many ways that the principles of </span><strong><span>Feng Shui</span></strong><span> , along with other natural healing methods, can help </span><strong><span>prevent and relieve headaches</span></strong><span> . Harmonization in our living and working spaces, coupled with complementary approaches such as </span><strong><span>acupuncture</span></strong><span> , </span><strong><span>meditation</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>yoga</span></strong><span> , offers a holistic path to pain relief and promoting general well-being.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><span>An ancient wisdom from Feng Shui teaches us that “When you change the conditions in your external life, there is a corresponding change in your internal life.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span>This underlines the importance of a balanced and harmonious environment for our health and well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>Taking a </span><strong><span>holistic approach</span></strong><span> to pain relief, taking into account both the external environment and internal balance and self-care, is a powerful approach to improving quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span>Consciously shaping our surroundings, being mindful of our body and mind, and opening up to complementary natural healing methods can together make a significant difference in our experience of well-being and pain relief.</span></p>
<p><span>By applying the principles of Feng Shui and embracing a variety of natural healing methods, we create a solid foundation for a healthy, harmonious life. This holistic approach allows us to take control of our well-being and actively work to improve our quality of life. This is how the path of harmony and balance leads us to a fulfilled and pain-free life.</span></p>

                <p><span>It doesn't take much effort to conjure up the magical world of Aladdin, Scheherazade and Ali Baba in your own home. Through careful planning and selecting suitable furniture, you can design your living space in an oriental style and dream of the distant lands of the Orient at any time.</span></p>
<p><span>Find out what is typical of the oriental look, what role Feng Shui plays in it and how you can make the dream from 1001 Nights come true. Above all, learn how you can use oriental colors to have a healing effect.</span></p>
<p><span>How do oriental looks and vintage furniture from India go together? Strictly speaking, “Orient” is not a geographical description. The Land of the Rising Sun, also known as the Orient, is rather culturally and religiously influenced, so that South Asian countries such as India or China can also be included. There are many similarities, especially when it comes to the teachings of Feng Shui.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>What Feng Shui has to do with well-being</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Feng Shui is intended to help you find peace and strength through a harmonious environment. There are rules and tips for furnishing your home. Thanks to this, life energy can flow undisturbed, which is why you can feel really comfortable in your home. Because we know from our daily experience that every room is energetically connected to us.</span></p>
<p><span>Feng Shui is also known in Indian culture. The facility is intended to allow people to harmonize with their surroundings through a special design of living spaces.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_269876770-bearbeitet-1024x519.jpg" alt="Fortune cookie with saying: Time to change your life" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Living like in 1001 Nights – That's how it's done</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Feng Shui doesn't just look at a furnishing style, but rather the arrangement and design of your home. This allows you to develop freely and design your home according to your personal preferences.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to be particularly comfortable and immerse yourself in a world of dreams, then the oriental living style is an excellent choice. But what sets him apart?</span></p>
<p><span>As soon as you enter your apartment, an exotic world full of colors and magnificent decorations awaits you. This style combines comfort with a healthy dose of extravagance.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Thousands of years of tradition and modernity merge in Indian furniture style.</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Vintage furniture from India is characterized by ancient Indian crafts and contemporary elements. They are often made of solid wood such as teak, acacia, mango or shisham. Real vintage furniture, which is made from recycled wood by skilled carpenters, is particularly charming. In India, new wood is scarce and expensive, so old wood is often given new life. Wooden elements from old mansions are used, such as old windows, doors, balconies and gables.</span></p>
<p><span>Fine carvings and numerous small details give the furniture an extravagant antique look, as is the case with furniture from </span><span>Home and Garden</span><span> . Another highlight are painted cabinets and chests of drawers, which are eye-catchers with lively colors and artistic ornaments. Do you prefer it simpler? Then the colonial style with dark wood and shiny metal fittings might suit you better.</span></p>
<p><span>Accessories are not only permitted in oriental and Indian furnishing styles, but are also a perfect complement to the carefully selected furniture. Poufs and seat cushions in patchwork style, sofas and armchairs with a variety of colorful, magnificently shimmering cushions made of fine brocade create a glamorous maharajah look. Canopies, carpets, curtains and printed blankets made of silk, brocade and cotton also contribute to a fairytale atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span>This offers the opportunity to work with colors from Feng Shui teachings.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/feng-shui-pflanze-in-einer-vase.jpg" alt="Feng Shui plant in a white vase" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Colors in the oriental style: spiritual effects and healing powers</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Yellow, the color of the earth and the sun, symbolizes the connection between heaven and earth. Yellow not only exudes coziness, but also has healing potential on a physical and mental level. This radiant color represents the power of the spirit and brightens the mood. It is often used to provide relief from problems such as rheumatism, osteoarthritis, stone formation and digestive problems.</span></p>
<p><span>Orange, on the other hand, stands for joy of life, inspiration, creativity and communication. It promotes the performance of the kidneys, bladder, glands and respiratory tract, increases the release of adrenaline, constricts the blood vessels, accelerates the pulse and increases the body temperature. This makes orange ideal for the oriental style.</span></p>
<p><span>Violet represents spirituality and meditation, and is said to stabilize damaged nerves. Violet also gives every room an oriental touch, making wooden elements and furniture appear more graceful and set accents.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Green – The longing for the Orient</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Professor Dr. Ernst Pöppel, full professor of the Institute for Medical Psychology at the LMU in Munich, one of the researchers who have intensively studied the effects of colors, confirms: “It is remarkable that almost all living things have developed optical receptors whose sensitivity is in the absorption range of chlorophyll, i.e. the color of leaves. This is our evolutionary heritage and touches on the emotional memory of our ancestors. Humans have a built-in longing for green, so to speak.”</span></p>
<p><span>Green stabilizes and is also very important in the Orient. That's why, according to Professor Pöppel, we strive to put up houseplants, green balconies or create gardens: "We need plants in our surroundings because they connect us to the world in a very original way." They can also be used in therapy. Plants can be easily integrated, especially in the oriental style.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/farben-wirken-auf-uns-sehr.jpg" alt="A painting in different colors" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Blue – The source of energy</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Blue is of great importance to humans as it is the most energetic color. Colors differ mainly in their wavelength. Blue has a wavelength of 450 nanometers and is therefore short-wave and high in energy compared to other colors. This is already used in psychiatry. Scientists have found that blue is the optimal color for depressed people who feel weak and lacking in energy. In the Orient, these colors are deliberately used to bring freshness and coolness into the room.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Red – The warming effect</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Red, on the other hand, has a wavelength of 750 nanometers, making this color long-wave and low-energy. Reddish tones have a warming and calming effect on the mood.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Professor Pöppel, the fact that colors can trigger physical sensations, as a side effect, is possible because they work in both the conscious and unconscious parts of the brain. The information from the retina is switched in the diencephalon to the cerebral cortex, where the perceived colors are then interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span>The combination of oriental flair and healing colors offers the best way to strengthen health with beautiful elements.</span></p>

                <p><span>Houses that are furnished according to Feng Shui simply appear more pleasant and comfortable the first time you enter a room and seem to be beneficial to human nature.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if it is not possible to measure at first glance what exactly it is about Feng Shui that has such an impact on our perception of a room, the </span><span> rules of room design</span><span> that are practiced in Feng Shui have an effect.</span></p>
<p><span>By observing these often very complex rules and the clever use of </span>colors<span> , shapes and the correct division of living areas in the house, a lot can be achieved in your own home.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The house floor plan</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>A fundamental step in designing a property according to Feng Shui is to create the correct layout of the room. This starts with the planning of the property. Here you can make sure that the rooms are suitable when you buy the house.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to find the right property, you have various options, one of which would be to search via  </span><span>www.gelbeseiten.de</span><span> . The basic idea of ​​creating spaces for activity and retreats for periods of rest suggests why the Far Eastern philosophy is effective in interior design.</span></p>
<p><span>Assigning individual themes to the rooms and using them only for that purpose can be important, for example in order to be able to really concentrate at work or to really relax in the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom .</span></p>
<p><span>When there are no distracting elements in sight, it is easier to devote yourself to the phase of the day. However, Feng Shui even specifies the floor plan of how exactly the rooms should ideally be divided.</span></p>
<p><span>It is not possible to implement the rooms positively in every apartment and in every house, as floor plans are always different.</span></p>
<p><span>However, Feng Shui also provides some tricks here to help balance things out if a room is too small or the rooms are not designed to be square or rectangular.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Hausfassaden-nach-Feng-Shui_2.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Consider the five elements </span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Another essential pillar in Feng Shui concerns the five elements of wood, fire, earth, water and metal.</span></p>
<p><span>Each of these elements is assigned different properties, such as colors or cardinal directions. For example, wood is symbolized by shades of green, while the element of fire can be strengthened by red or orange.</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is assigned a beneficial element. This can be determined based on the time of birth. There are not only beneficial elements in room design, but also negative elements.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if there are blue decorations or an aquarium in the room that reflect the element of water, this has a nourishing effect on a wood person. On the other hand, metal furniture or silver tones can have a negative effect on a wooden person. There are beneficial and negative colors or elements for each group of elements.</span></p>
<p><span>This should be taken into account especially when choosing colors for home furnishings. If you want to know exactly and on your own personal level, you should also look into the </span><span>Chinese zodiac sign</span><span> .</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The life energy Qi </span></strong></h2>
<p><span>One concept underlying Feng Shui is that of the life energy Qi. According to the theory of design, life energy flows through our entire world. Places where Qi can flow feel positive and good and promote our well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Feng Shui, places where it cannot flow are places that do not promote our energy. Therefore, residents of a household should always strive to ensure that Qi can flow. If you walk through rooms carefully, you can see a lot for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>Where untidy corners catch the eye, worn furniture or even impractical corners are dictated by the shape of the building, the Qi also stalls. On the one hand, it is important to ensure order, but on the other hand, targeted </span><span>Feng Shui decorative elements</span><span> and other furniture can help to let the life energy Qi flow again.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Your 10 tips for a successful home</span></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong><span>Decluttering and organizing:</span></strong><span> Before you start your Feng Shui design, make sure you're organized and get rid of unnecessary things. A tidy home creates better energy.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Use the compass school:</span></strong><span> The compass is your guide in Feng Shui design. It divides your home into nine areas and helps you determine the best place for different elements and colors.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Color design:</span></strong><span> Use colors that match the individual areas of the bagua. For example, use calming blues in the area of ​​learning or bold reds in the area of ​​passion and love.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Natural materials:</span></strong><span> Use natural materials such as wood, stone and fabrics to create a connection with nature.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Symbols and Decoration:</span></strong><span> Use symbols and </span><span>Feng Shui decorative elements</span><span> that promote positive energies, such as mirrors, plants, and artwork.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Arrangement of furniture:</span></strong><span> Arrange your furniture in a way that allows for good energy circulation. This means that you should not block the flow of traffic.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Bedroom design:</span></strong><span> Pay particular attention to the design of your bedroom, as this is an important space for relaxation and regeneration. Position your bed so that it has a good view of the door, but is not directly in front of it.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Cleaning and maintenance:</span></strong><span> Keep your home clean and well-maintained as this increases energy quality.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Lighting:</span></strong><span> Use natural light wherever possible and complement it with mood lighting.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Personal Intention:</span></strong><span> Remember that Feng Shui is also influenced by your personal intention and attitude. Visualize positive changes and goals as you design your home.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Use Feng Shui advice </span></strong></h2>
<p><span>If you want to create fundamental changes at home and let the life energy Qi flow, you can also get professional help. With a </span><span>Feng Shui consultation</span><span> , an expert person is available to take a close look at the rooms in the household, analyze them and make recommendations for redesigning them. Our service is often used by companies for offices and workplaces. </span></p>
<p><span>But I think it's best to learn Feng Shui yourself so that you can bring about changes at any time.</span></p>

                <p>Our own four walls are a place in which we want to feel comfortable. They give us relaxation, give us warmth and security.</p>
<p>What is important is not only the furnishings of the apartment in terms of the furniture and how they coordinate with each other, but also the light, which has a major influence on the atmosphere and gives the apartment a sense of security.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Feng Shui and light</strong></h2>
<p>The life energy Qi plays a central role in Feng Shui. Therefore, light as an energy source plays an essential role in the design of living spaces. It gives you joy of life, keeps you warm and gives your own four walls the pleasant atmosphere that is so important for your well-being.</p>
<p>The room should be as fully lit as possible so that the energies can flow. According to the principles of the Taoist theory of harmony, dark areas prevent the flow of Qi. Therefore, you should choose many small spots and light sources that interact harmoniously with each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Colorful lampshades in warm colors also accentuate neglected corners, set the mood and give the room a very special touch.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Large ceiling spotlights, on the other hand, are less suitable for lighting in the spirit of Feng Shui. They mainly irradiate the floor, are blinding and take up too much space and attention.</p>
<p>Here too, more subtle LED spots are the better option. The choice of lighting is essential in relation to the use of space. While you should aim for warm and soft lighting in the F eng Shui bedroom and avoid bluish light entirely, you can choose lighter colors in other rooms. In an office at home, for example, the light can be a little brighter to ensure that there is enough energy for work.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How light and seasons are related</strong></h2>
<p>The basic principles of Feng Shui apply all year round. Nevertheless, appropriate adjustments can be made at certain times of the year.</p>
<p>The darkness of winter affects many people, while summer is a period of warmth and light thanks to its brightness.</p>
<p>Such strong contrasts should also be reflected in the planning of your lighting. Summer is characterized by fire, whose characteristics also influence the emotional state - and are often associated with many emotions.</p>
<p>In summer you should therefore darken the rooms, especially in the Feng Shui bedroom, so that the energy stays outside. This ensures better sleep.</p>
<p>Autumn, on the other hand, is often seen in art as a motif for letting go, change and even dying. It is the time to pause.</p>
<p>In order to avoid an overly depressing autumn melancholy, stronger and warmer lighting helps. It not only captures the beauty of autumn, but also gives you strength.</p>
<p>This principle applies even more in winter, when the trees are bare and the cold is pouring in.</p>
<p>In spring, however, departure and something new begins. You can welcome the energy of nature, which is now gaining momentum again, back into your home. Greenish light as a symbol of blossoming invites you to start the new year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Stunning_industrial_loft_bedroom-1024x570.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How lack of light negatively affects our health</strong></h2>
<p><br>Light has noticeable and measurable effects on the human body. For example, light plays a significant role in the production of vitamin D.</p>
<p>This circumstance means that around one in three people in Germany have too little vitamin D in their blood during the less light months of the cold season.</p>
<p>The further north people live, the more often this happens. One way you can prevent vitamin D deficiency is to take advantage of the few hours of sunshine and exercise outdoors as much as possible or ensure there is plenty of light.</p>
<p>Large windows and curtains and drapes can help to give the light a chance to penetrate the apartment.</p>
<p>This also promotes your sleep rhythm, which can sometimes be disrupted due to a lack of light. Daylight lamps, which prevent the process of melatonin formation, help.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a hormone that helps you fall asleep. Daylight lamps help you stay awake and fit during the day so that you can sleep soundly at night.</p>
<p>However, daylight lamps are not a replacement for bright sunlight. This is also revealed by a look at the illuminance of different light sources. Illuminance is measured in lux and shows how much light falls on a surface.</p>
<p>On bright summer days without a cloud in the sky, that's 100,000 lux that reaches us and even in winter when the weather is clear, the sun pampers us with up to 20,000 lux.</p>
<p>Even the brightest daylight lamp, which has around 6000 lux, cannot do this. Usually the brightest rooms in the home, often the office, only reach 500 lux.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Colors can determine our feelings</strong></h2>
<p>The influence of colors on our minds has been well documented. Blue has a communicative and stimulating effect and should therefore be used especially during the day.</p>
<p>Warmer colors such as orange and yellow improve our mood, while pink has a relaxing effect on our bodies.</p>
<p>The correct use of different colors can be crucial to how we feel in our home. At gluehbirne.de you will find the right light bulbs to create the atmosphere in your home so that you feel safe, your creativity is stimulated or you can start the day full of energy.</p>
<p>The color of the walls has a very significant influence on the overall picture. Bright red walls can hardly tame the flow of energy, even with subtle lighting, while gray colors can appear cool and anxious.</p>
<p>Here, of course, the relationship to the space is again important. So make sure you choose the right color for your wallpaper so that the right lighting can be effective. This is the only way to ensure a good flow of life energy. Since Feng Shui strives to bring all sensory experiences into harmony , you should make sure that not only the colors and brightness match each other, but that they also harmonize with the rest of your surroundings.</p>
<p>In addition to visual impressions, the senses of touch and hearing also influence our body and mind.</p>

                <p>Human hearing is a complex and fascinating sensory organ that allows us to connect and interact with our surroundings. It allows us to hear voices, enjoy music and warns us of danger.</p>
<p>Hearing loss, whether gradual or sudden, can significantly impair our connection to the world around us and presents those affected with major challenges in their daily lives. However, it's not just about the ability to hear sounds and speech.</p>
<p>Hearing loss can also affect social life, mental health and overall quality of life. People with hearing loss often report a feeling of isolation, difficulty communicating and reduced participation in social life.</p>
<p>In this context, Feng Shui and Chinese medicine offer alternative and complementary approaches to not only make life with hearing loss easier, but also enrich it.</p>
<p>These ancient wisdoms, deeply rooted in the harmony between people and the environment, offer holistic methods to strengthen physical and mental balance and promote well-being.</p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Feng Shui and its relationship to the element of water</h2>
<p>In the ancient Chinese teaching of Feng Shui, the element of water plays a central and symbolic role. Water, as one of the five basic elements, is believed to have a deep connection to our sensory organs, particularly the ears.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese philosophy, water represents not only physical qualities such as flow and adaptability, but also deeper, metaphorical meanings such as wisdom, depth and calm.</p>
<p>For people living with hearing loss, these qualities are particularly important. Water symbolizes the ability to adapt to change and flow in harmony with the environment. These characteristics can be particularly useful for dealing with the challenges and changes that accompany hearing loss.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Hoerverlust-und-Feng-Shui-2-1024x685.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The element of water is well used</h2>
<p>The integration of water elements in the Feng Shui living room and workspace can be done in a variety of ways. A classic example is a small indoor fountain. The gentle sound of water can have a calming effect while symbolizing the constant flow and adaptability that is so important when dealing with hearing loss.</p>
<p>It's not just about the physical presence of water, but also what it represents: a continuous flow of energy and harmony.</p>
<p>In addition, images of water landscapes, such as oceans, rivers or lakes, can be used in the design of rooms. These images serve not only as aesthetic elements, but also as visual reminders of the fluidity and adaptability that water symbolizes.</p>
<p>Such depictions can help promote a sense of calm and inner peace, which can be particularly valuable for people with hearing loss.</p>
<p>The practice of Feng Shui is about creating and maintaining a balance between the different elements. Consciously incorporating the water element into the design of our living spaces can help create a harmonious balance that supports well-being. This is particularly important in rooms where relaxation and calm are to be encouraged. Particular attention should be paid to the Feng Shui bedroom .</p>
<p>Ultimately, using the water element in Feng Shui is about creating an environment that is both physically and emotionally supportive. For people with hearing loss, this can make a significant contribution to improving their quality of life by helping them find inner peace and better adapt to the challenges of everyday life.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Room design according to Feng Shui to promote harmony</h2>
<p>Interior design according to the principles of Feng Shui is not just a question of aesthetic taste, but rather a tool to increase well-being and quality of life. This is especially true for people who face challenges such as hearing loss. A carefully designed environment can be instrumental in promoting balance and inner harmony.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><strong>Harmonious furniture arrangement:</strong> The placement of the furniture should be chosen so that it allows an unhindered flow of energy ( Qi ). It is important to create an inviting and open atmosphere, especially in rooms that are used for relaxation and communication. This can be achieved by arranging furniture in a way that promotes both privacy and community. Particular attention should be paid to the Feng Shui living room and the Feng Shui bedroom .</li>
<li><strong>Color choice for a calming atmosphere: </strong>Colors play an important role in creating a harmonious environment. Soft tones such as blue and green are known to have a calming and relaxing effect. These colors can promote mental calm and help alleviate the emotional challenges associated with hearing loss.</li>
<li><strong>Natural elements and plants:</strong> Incorporating natural elements such as plants or natural materials can strengthen the connection to nature and increase well-being. Plants not only add aesthetics, but also improve air quality and promote a feeling of vibrancy and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced lighting:</strong> Well-thought-out lighting that includes both natural and artificial light can positively influence mood. Soft, indirect light creates a pleasant atmosphere that can be both relaxing and energizing.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chinese medicine and its perspective on hearing loss</h2>
<p>Chinese medicine offers a holistic approach to treating hearing loss by viewing it in the context of the entire body and its energy flows. This approach goes beyond the symptoms and addresses the causes and underlying energetic imbalances.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Herbal therapy</h3>
<p>Various herbs are used in traditional Chinese medicine to support and strengthen hearing. From the perspective of Chinese medicine, the kidneys are also affected by hearing loss. These herbs can help improve blood circulation, reduce inflammation, strengthen the kidneys, and restore overall energetic balance. Alternative treatment methods should also be discussed with your doctor.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Acupuncture</h3>
<p>Acupuncture is a well-known method of Chinese medicine that involves placing fine needles at specific points on the body to regulate and harmonize the flow of energy. If you have hearing loss, acupuncture can help clear the underlying energetic blockages and support the function of the ear.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Qi Gong and Tai Chi</h3>
<p>These gentle forms of movement help to harmonize and strengthen the flow of energy in the body. Regular practice can improve overall well-being and reduce stress to lessen the effects of hearing loss.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nutritional advice</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine places great emphasis on a balanced diet to promote health. Specific foods and dietary recommendations can help support ear health and improve overall well-being.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Integration of modern technologies and traditional wisdom</h2>
<p>It can be said that both Feng Shui and Chinese medicine offer valuable and enriching approaches to supporting life with hearing loss.</p>
<p>They help strengthen the balance between body and mind and promote a deep understanding of the importance of harmony and balance in our daily lives. These ancient traditions can teach us how to adapt our environment and behavior to achieve greater levels of well-being, despite the challenges that come with hearing loss.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should not underestimate the importance of modern technologies, especially hearing aids.</p>
<p>They offer significant help with hearing loss and can significantly improve quality of life.</p>
<p>Hearing aids enable people with hearing impairments to communicate more effectively, participate in social life and fully enjoy the joys of everyday life. In addition, hearing aid prices are reasonable and the costs are subsidized accordingly by health insurance, so you don't have to worry and everyone can have access to appropriate hearing aid.</p>
<p>Combining technological solutions such as hearing aids with the holistic approaches of Feng Shui and Chinese medicine represents a comprehensive strategy to address the challenges of hearing loss.</p>
<p>Through this integrative approach – combining modern technology with ancient wisdom – people with hearing loss can lead balanced and fulfilling lives. She encourages us to look both outward to technological solutions and inward to personal growth and harmony. This creates a holistic path that encompasses and enriches the most diverse aspects of life with hearing loss.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Furnishing according to Feng Shui – the most important tips without high costs</span></h2>
<p><span>Designing your rooms according to Feng Shui doesn't cost you any money at first. By considering the basics of Chinese teachings, you are already contributing to a harmonious living environment. The perfect locations for furnishings can be calculated </span><span>using well-known Feng Shui formulas</span><span> . Regardless of the zone or room, consider the following basic tips for the perfect result:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Light is desired:</span></strong><span> In order to let life into your rooms, you need light. Keep the curtains open during the day, use light colors and combine islands of light in each room.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Choose materials:</span></strong><span> To stimulate the flow of Qi, use mirrors and glasses. They are used as wind chimes, candlesticks or </span><span>decorative bowls</span><span> . For calming zones, you use wood and natural stone that fit harmoniously into the surroundings.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Keep things organized:</span></strong><span> Shelves and cupboards with closed doors contribute to more structure and order. Avoid an excess of decorations, but rather rely on cleverly placed highlights.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Consider the seasons:</span></strong><span> Change your accessories depending on the season. In spring, fresh flowers symbolize the arrival of new energy, in winter you can bring harmony and idyll home with a flower arrangement.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Integrate plants:</span></strong><span> The free window area poses the risk of losing Qi. Place plants on the windowsill to keep Qi in the room and support Chinese teachings.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Use Feng Shui in every room - it can be done without high costs</span></h2>
<p><span>Feng </span><span>Shui is used in work rooms</span><span> as well as in </span><span>Feng Shui living rooms</span><span> and </span><span>Feng Shui bedrooms</span><span> . Basically, you won't incur any extra costs if you furnish your house according to the teachings of Feng Shui. We have put together some basic tips for every room that won't break your budget and still bring the art of Feng Shui into your home.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your bedroom</span></h3>
<p><span>Save on decorative items</span><span> in this place to keep the energy flowing. Minimalist furnishing styles are very popular; when choosing colors, pay attention to soft tones for Qi, peace and coziness. Order is crucial for the flow of Qi. Use closed cupboards and let clutter disappear.</span></p>
<p><span>Mirrors have no place in the bedroom because they create inner turmoil. Instead, decorate your walls with photos of your loved ones. It's not expensive and at the same time provides a pleasant feeling of coziness. Electrical devices are absolutely taboo in your bedroom. </span><span>Electrosmog affects your sleep</span><span> and imbalances the Qi.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your study</span></h3>
<p><span>Once you have set up your home office at home, the desk is very important. Make sure you look directly at the door when you sit at your place of work. The windows should be on the opposite side of your strong hand. If you are left-handed, the window to your right is in the right place. By working with your back to the wall, the Qi can flow optimally through the room and give you the energy you need.</span></p>
<p><span>Remove clocks and calendars as decorative elements from your study, as they unconsciously create pressure. Instead, rely on green plants. They give your room harmony and contribute to an optimal indoor climate. As in the living room, the center of the room should remain free. You place electrical devices against the wall, keeping the best possible distance from your desk.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-kostenguenstig-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> is the place of regular transformations. Here you transform raw food into meals. A high flow of Qi is important, so use natural elements when furnishing. When choosing your worktop, graphite and wood are well suited as raw materials. Compare prices online and look out for discounts to save money.</span></p>
<p><span>If you work in the kitchen, your gaze should be towards the door if possible. The choice of dining table (if you have enough space) is very important. Round and oval tables allow for better communication strategies; the Qi intersects at square tables. The placement of the knives is particularly important. Avoid knife blocks as they pose a danger to Qi. To safely store the sharp blades, choose a closed drawer.</span></p>
<p><span>Water and fire are the two central elements in the kitchen and they do not harmonize with each other. Place the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher away from the stove and oven to incorporate a safe distance. Red, green, cream and white are considered suitable </span><span>colors</span><span> for the kitchen. Natural elements such as stone and wood fit very well.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your living room</span></h3>
<p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> is the perfect place for mirrors. This expands your view and ensures an optical increase in size. To save money, buy your mirrors second hand or browse a flea market. Maybe your neighbors, friends or grandparents also have decorative mirrors in the basement that they would like to pass on to you for a small amount of money.</span></p>
<p><span>To prevent Qi blockages, keep doors open in the living room. If you want to integrate a privacy screen, airy and loose curtains are suitable for the door frames. The most important rules also include a free middle. Avoid furniture in the middle of the room, otherwise the Qi cannot flow into all corners of the room.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a warm atmosphere at the same time, cover the floor in the middle of the room with light, warm carpets. Look for bargains and special offers to save your budget.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Feng Shui doesn’t have to be expensive – buy your furnishings cheaply!</span></h2>
<p><span>The teachings of Feng Shui do not dictate how expensive your furniture and decorations have to be. Instead, it is primarily about the type of furnishings, the use of appropriate colors and the placement of furniture.</span></p>
<p><span>Theoretically, you can set up an apartment suitable for Feng Shui using your existing furniture. You may just need to replace individual elements. Closed cupboards are better than open shelves, round coffee and dining tables promote communication.</span></p>
<p><span>In the age of the Internet, you have many opportunities to save money when buying furniture. Take advantage of deals, offers and discounts so you spend less money on your facility. Also compare prices, because not every dealer is actually cheaper. To live according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> , you don't need a lot of money. What is more important is the willingness to rearrange your rooms and thus ensure optimal Qi flow.</span></p>

                <p><span>Sustainability is a topic that is becoming increasingly important in society. It therefore does not ignore people who want to furnish their rooms according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> or have already furnished them. The question for them is how Feng Shui and sustainability aspects can be reconciled. A common consideration is investing in a solar system, as this brings with it numerous advantages. However, </span><span>negative effects such as electrosmog</span><span> are often feared. It is therefore worth taking a closer look at the topic so that you can make the best decision for your individual case.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How are Feng Shui and sustainability related?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Feng Shui plays an important role for more and more people when they build a house or furnish their apartment. Nevertheless, they also have to take other aspects into account, for example legal requirements, financial aspects or sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span>Solar systems are becoming increasingly popular as a way to make a valuable contribution to the fight against climate change and to become independent of network operators and rising costs. There are not only financial arguments in favor of a photovoltaic system on the roof, but also financial ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Modern systems can now be installed on a variety of different roofs, which is why it is definitely worth getting professional advice, clarifying the individual options and </span><span>realistically calculating</span><span> the costs for the solar system . The only question that remains is whether and to what extent such a PV system on the roof also affects Feng Shui, even though it is not really visible or noticeable inside the house?</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, Feng Shui and sustainability are closely related, so that an influence of the solar system on the interior of the rooms or the well-being in them cannot be ruled out with certainty.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, Feng Shui is about the flow of energy, which can be promoted through natural design but can also be disrupted by influences such as electrosmog. It is also recommended to choose elements that are as natural as possible, which a solar system cannot achieve, at least at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span>However, it corresponds to another Feng Shui principle: a sustainable environment has a positive effect on mental and physical health. A design according to Feng Shui and a solar system on the roof can therefore complement each other perfectly, but the combination also brings with it some stumbling blocks that need to be known and taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Electrosmog from solar systems – is the fear justified?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>At best, a solar system should not disrupt the appearance and functionality of your own four walls. Since it is located outside the field of vision, this is usually not a problem indoors. This aspect needs to be given more consideration when designing outdoor areas. But according to Feng Shui, a photovoltaic system can also cause disruptions inside, namely </span><span>through potential electrosmog</span><span> .</span></p>
<p><span>In principle, solar panels have no negative impact on well-being or the flow of energy in your own home, as they fit harmoniously into the roof.</span></p>
<p><span>There are always discussions only with regard to electric fields. In order to realistically evaluate this influence, it is worth finding out about the technology in the PV modules: The electricity is generated in the form of direct current, i.e. a magnetic constant field is created, which causes significantly fewer problems with regard to electrosmog than a direct current Alternating field.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, electricity production does not take place permanently, but only when there is sufficient sunlight and therefore only during the day. There is therefore no need to worry about sleep disorders caused by electrosmog caused by a PV generator.</span></p>
<p><span>Other influences include the size of the system, the extent of electricity production and the types of inverters.</span></p>
<p><span>The bottom line is that the problem with electrosmog in solar systems is significantly smaller than is often assumed. However, the fear is not completely unfounded, because sooner or later the direct current generated must of course be converted into grid-compliant alternating current and this happens in the so-called inverter. This can lead to the already mentioned, more critical alternating magnetic fields, regardless of the time of day or night.</span></p>

<p><span>Grounding the module field is then the most effective and at the same time simplest solution.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Pay attention to earth radiation</span></h2>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><span>Systems on residential building roofs should only be considered in conjunction with so-called earth radiation shielding, as otherwise considerable additional stress can arise from reflections. Both photovoltaic and solar systems as well as thermal insulation in the roof, which consist of glass wool with aluminum foil, cause large-scale radiation reflections due to their metallized surfaces. This leads to increased radiation exposure in the rooms on the upper floor. These reflections can only be avoided by using a shielding coating, for example in the basement or on the floor.</span></mark></p>
<p><strong><span>Make sure there is enough space between the modules and rooms used during the day.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Grounding the modules is essential.</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid the formation of large conductor loops.</span></p>
<p><span>Use shielded, grounded string lines or place them in grounded pipes.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Tips to avoid electrosmog caused by photovoltaics</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The fact is that solar systems can create electrosmog, just like all other electronic devices in your home. However, this danger is much smaller than is often assumed and there are simple solutions to minimize electrosmog or – better yet – completely prevent it. Here are some helpful tips so that you don't have to miss out on the advantages of a photovoltaic system, but can still furnish your home according to Feng Shui and protect it from electrosmog:</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>1. </span><strong><span>Ground the module field.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>As you already know, it makes sense to ground the module field of the solar system in order to minimize or completely eliminate electrosmog. It is worth speaking to an experienced expert about this in order to integrate the PV system into your own home right from the start so that it does not become an energy disruptive factor. Such grounding or dissipation may also be useful for other components to minimize electromagnetic interference and ensure that it is dissipated properly.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>2. </span><strong><span>Separate the PV generator and the living spaces.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>It also makes sense to install the generator as far as possible from the rooms where you spend the most time. The more distance possible, the better. If in doubt, it is better to position it near the rooms in which you stay at night rather than those that are your main place of residence during the day - since the solar system does not work at night.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>3. </span><strong><span>Avoid conductor loops if possible.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Conductor loops are also</span><span> a common cause of electrosmog from electronic devices . They should therefore only be used in the smallest possible number and in the smallest possible size, for example as lightning protection for the solar system.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>4. </span><strong><span>Make sure there is good shielding.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>If the distance between the solar system and the living room or bedroom is too short so that you fear energy disruptions caused by electrosmog, additional shielding may make sense. There are special shielding materials and colors available that can help reduce electrosmog. So find out whether these paints and materials are available and useful in your individual case to block potential electromagnetic radiation.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>5. </span><strong><span>Invest in special cabling.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Shielding also makes sense for the cabling, as this often has points of contact with the living spaces and is therefore also a potential source of electrosmog. The cables and technology should therefore be shielded with suitable materials, which is why professional advice is worthwhile before laying.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>6. </span><strong><span>Take regular EMF measurements.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>If you are still unsure whether the solar system and its components are causing electrosmog in your home, </span><span>regular EMF measurements</span><span> are a good idea . Special EMF measuring devices help monitor exposure to electromagnetic fields and take countermeasures if necessary. Furthermore, an electrical installation specialist or a special EMF expert can provide a professional assessment of the situation and help prevent electrosmog from the solar system.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>7. </span><strong><span>Combat electrosmog through frequency management.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Combating electrosmog with electronic devices doesn't sound very effective at first glance. However, there are now special technologies that control radio frequencies and can thereby minimize electromagnetic pollution. It is therefore worthwhile to at least inform yourself about the options and check to what extent their use in your four walls makes sense.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>8. </span><strong><span>The solar system should be checked regularly.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Finally, it can happen that electrosmog only arises over time when the solar system is damaged, the shielding materials become brittle or malfunctions occur. Regular inspection and maintenance of the PV system is therefore essential - these are often already included in the services of the provider who also carries out the installation.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In summary, there is nothing wrong with installing a solar system on the roof if you have designed your apartment or house according to Feng Shui. However, it is important to inform yourself about the special features described and to take appropriate measures to prevent or minimize electrosmog. Then you can make optimal use of the advantages of your own PV system without having to worry about energy or other disadvantages - for a life in harmony with Feng Shui and sustainability.</span></p>

                    <p><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/17/Feng-Shui-Sitzen-320x213.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!" /></p>
                <p><span>Most people spend a significant portion of their waking hours sitting. </span><span>Depending on the scientific source,</span><span> we spend between 8.5 and even 11.5 hours per day in a sitting position.</span></p>
<p><span>We sit at work, in the car or on public transport, at meals and during our evening leisure activities in front of the television or reading. On average, the time spent sitting or lying down is less, which does not have a positive long-term effect on health and well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes it all the more important to design sitting in such a way that it promotes health and well-being or at least does not have a negative impact. In addition to the diverse ergonomic aspects that scientific findings require to be taken into account, Feng Shui can also make a valuable contribution to healthy sitting. Positioning seating furniture according to Feng Shui can have a positive influence on the flow of energy and thus bring many good changes into your life. This means that even long periods of sitting can become a feel-good experience.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The living room as the energy center of the apartment</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In Feng Shui, the </span><span>living room</span><span> is often referred to as the lungs of the house or apartment. Just as the lungs distribute the breath of life throughout the body, Qi also flows from the living room into all living areas.</span></p>
<p><span>In most households, sitting is the predominant posture in the living room. We sit comfortably on the sofa or in armchairs when we are entertained by the television, read a good book, do handicrafts or are engrossed in good conversations. Comfortable seating with a feel-good factor is therefore essential in this central room.</span></p>
<p><span>For most people, the sofa is the centerpiece of a cozy </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> . The positioning of this piece of furniture should therefore be done with care. The sofa also receives special attention in Feng Shui.</span></p>
<p><span>While the trend in modern living concepts is to position furniture primarily along the walls, according to Feng Shui, the sofa is unthinkable without a solid wall behind it.</span></p>
<p><span>The cozy heart of your living room should find its place with the entire backrest against a protective wall. This conveys security and security and fulfills a primal human need that goes back to our very first relatives in prehistoric times.</span></p>
<p><span>When people still lived in caves, it was important for their survival never to have the cave entrance behind them, but rather to entrust this unprotected side to a stable wall.</span></p>
<p><span>The focus was on the opening of the cave in order to be able to identify dangers early. This genetic program accompanies us to this day and also finds its place in Feng Shui. With your back against the protective wall, the view from the sofa is directed towards the doors and windows and thus conveys security and security in your personal comfort zone.</span></p>
<p><span>When the subconscious feels protection, the mind can calm down and is free to devote itself to creative and energetic thoughts.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting at the desk according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The desk is an area in which concentration and performance, creative energy and inventiveness are of great importance in everyday life. Especially at a time when the home desk has become more of a focus in professional areas, the design of this living area should be done consciously.</span></p>
<p><span>In the </span><span>Feng Shui workplace,</span><span> the positioning of the desk and office chair is crucial for the flow of energy and a free mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Similar to the sofa, the workplace should also be positioned so that there is a stable, protective wall behind it. This conveys security and thereby releases mental capacities that can be used for creativity and creativity.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are windows, glass elements as doors or walls, passageways or open space at the back, this can subconsciously cause constant unrest.</span></p>
<p><span>The body and mind remain in a tense and alert state and can prevent creative energy from flowing freely.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also not helpful if the front of the desk is directly in front of a wall.</span></p>
<p><span>This external blockage can also block thoughts and internal energy and limit thought processes.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, a clear view across the room is stimulating. A look out of the window can tempt people who tend to dream to wander all too easily and lose focus on what is important.</span></p>
<p><span>Here you should listen to yourself and find out what type of thinker you are and what environment is particularly good for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The office chair and desk should also meet ergonomic guidelines. If physical blockages arise due to an unhealthy posture when sitting for long periods of time at work, this also affects the flow of Qi and can significantly limit the ability to concentrate and perform.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Feng Shui in the dining room: Promote the flow of energy during meals</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In order to consciously enjoy a meal and support the digestive system, we should take time and sit down to eat. Whether in the dining area at home, in the canteen or in a restaurant, a mindfully designed area for meals can make a valuable contribution to well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining area plays a central role in everyday life. This is where the family comes together to exchange ideas and lovely people meet to enjoy themselves and have lively conversations. The dining room can also be used to reflect on the day's events in order to process them and clear the mind. This energy should also be reflected in the room design.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining area is best placed near the center of the apartment or house. The direct proximity to the </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> or the Feng Shui living room supports the energy that flows there.</span></p>
<p><span>In modern living concepts, the dining room is often no longer a separate room, but is integrated into the kitchen or living room. This means that meals can benefit from the energy flow there, as long as it is used consciously.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining table with sufficient seating for the people living in the household and guests is the center of the dining room.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike the sofa in the living room, it can also be placed in the room without requiring protective walls on all sides. At the dining table, however, it depends on where the view falls from the different seating positions.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Seating should be arranged so that people at the table can see each other without hindrance.</span></h3>
<p><span>This promotes communication and a feeling of connection.</span></p>
<p><span>High elements on the table top, such as towering plant arrangements, should therefore be avoided. The same applies to large and low-hanging lamps.</span></p>
<p><span>If possible, all seats should be arranged so that none of them are in the direct line between a window and a door. Looking directly at the bathroom or toilet door or the front door of the house or apartment also creates unrest and can disrupt the flow of energy.</span></p>
<p><span>If appropriate positioning cannot be avoided, a curtain or screen can be a flexible design aid and give the dining area its harmonious effect.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to chairs, the focus is on comfort. Nevertheless, they should not have excessive padding. A sufficiently high and wide backrest ensures seating comfort even during extended meals together and also suggests the protection and security that is achieved, for example, on a sofa by a solid wall in the back.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting on the balcony and terrace or in the garden</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>It's not just indoors that we spend many hours sitting. If you have a terrace, balcony or garden in your private area, you can also set up a cozy seating area there and thus create an additional living area that is close to nature and therefore particularly energetically appealing.</span></p>
<p><span>The rules of Feng Shui can also make an important contribution to more energy in life outdoors. The energy and Qi are channeled from the garden to the house. An </span><span>outdoor area designed according to Feng Shui</span><span> essentially determines how much energy can reach the domestic area and whether it can flow there undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span>The furniture used in an outdoor seating area should reflect the natural character in terms of look and feel.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/wittekind_lounge-4er-sofa_header_01-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><span>Wood is the preferred material that has these natural properties, does not heat up too much even in strong sunlight and can absorb and continue the energy of plants and trees. The </span><span>furniture manufacturer WITTEKIND</span><span> designs comfortable yet discreet outdoor lounge furniture made from sustainable wood that fits harmoniously into the energy flow of the Feng Shui garden.</span></p>

                <p><span>Plants play an important role in Feng Shui. Ultimately, in practice, Feng Shui aims to promote harmonious energies in rooms. Plants have also been proven to improve air quality and thus ensure greater well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>Plants in the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> are a special case . As already explained, humans and plants compete to a certain extent for oxygen at night. During the day, plants carry out photosynthesis. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span>This process is driven by daylight. Without light, this photosynthesis cannot take place. Instead, plants absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night. This process is called cellular respiration, an exchange of gases that occurs at a much lower rate than photosynthesis during the day.</span></p>
<p><span>In a normally ventilated room where plants are located, there is no risk of people and plants competing for oxygen. So there is no reason to ban plants from the bedroom. On the contrary. In </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> plants are also viewed as living sources of energy, which not least have a symbolic meaning for growth and harmony. They help attract and spread positive Qi energies.</span></p>

<p><span>We have already talked about the selection of plants. But it's not just the plant itself that matters, but also the material and color of the flower pots and their placement in the bedroom. With a </span><span>flower pot from pflanzenwerk.de,</span><span> every plant can be optimally showcased.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>color</span><span> of the flower pots can have a decisive influence on the energetic balance in the room. Terracotta, brown and yellow represent the earth element and create a warm atmosphere. These colors are well suited for rooms or areas that require calm and stability.</span></p>
<p><span>Green tones give a room a lively atmosphere and should be chosen carefully for the bedroom. This also applies to white, silver or metallic colors.</span></p>
<p><span>Blue and black, on the other hand, represent the water element in Feng Shui and can </span><span>bring a calming, flowing energy into the room</span><span> . Flower pots in these colors are ideal for rooms that are intended to promote relaxation and recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>The shapes of flower pots also have an energetic impact on the room. Round and oval flower pots create a calm, relaxed atmosphere. They are often used in the bedroom to support positive energy and create a pleasant environment.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of the flower pots is also important. If the pots are too small or too large in relation to the surrounding area, they can affect the energetic balance. Therefore, the size of the flower pots should be based on the size of the room and not have a dominating effect.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The right locations</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In order to create a harmonious environment, the placement of the flower pots in the bedroom is also important. Sharp corners or pointed edges should always be avoided near the bed to prevent negative energy.</span></p>
<p><span>The room must be well ventilated to allow positive circulation of Qi, the vital life energy, in </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . Effective ventilation not only promotes the free flow of Qi, but also supports a harmonious distribution of energy throughout the room.</span></p>
<p><span>In classical Feng Shui, specific areas of a room are considered according to the cardinal directions, with the placement of flower pots and other decorative elements strategically chosen to promote the balance of the five elements. This helps create a positive atmosphere and strengthens the energetic balance in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>Feng Shui emphasizes that any object, including a flower pot, has an energetic influence on the space. It is recommended that these items should be kept in perfect condition.</span></p>
<p><span>An intact and well-loved flower pot not only enhances the aesthetic beauty of the room, but also contributes positively to the energy quality. In the spirit of Feng Shui, the condition and care of each individual object is viewed as a reflection of the soul. It is therefore advisable to handle the objects consciously, to care for them and to care for them in order to create a positive and supportive atmosphere.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>It's all about caring for the plants</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Of course, proper care of the plants is also crucial for well-being and the atmosphere in the bedroom. To do this, you need to understand the needs of the respective plant species. Every plant has different requirements for light, water and nutrients.</span></p>
<p><span>Some plants need a lot of sunlight, others are happy with less. The plants I suggested, jasmine, ivy, lucky feather and money tree, tolerate a wide variety of lighting conditions and also feel quite comfortable in shady locations. The optimal temperature is 18 degrees, which is just right for the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span>These plants do not like direct sunlight, and they have something else in common: they </span><span>cannot tolerate waterlogging</span><span> . That's why you should water the plants in the bedroom regularly, but not excessively, and remove excess water from the planters. To promote the health of the plant, it is also important to always remove dead leaves immediately and occasionally shorten the plant slightly so that it does not grow excessively.</span></p>
<p><span>Careful care of your plants is particularly important in the bedroom because they are intended to provide a calming backdrop. Just the sight of well-cared for plants can reduce stress and improve your mood. Therefore, pay regular attention to the plants. Then they not only represent a decorative element, but also support a restful and harmonious night's sleep.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How many plants should there be?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>As I said, you should use plants sparingly in the bedroom. But how many plants are actually necessary to have a positive effect on the indoor climate? In fact, studies have shown that just a few plants can improve indoor air quality. Experts recommend placing at least one plant per 10 square meters of room space.</span></p>
<p><span>Among the particularly effective plants is the ivy. It is known for its ability to absorb airborne pollutants emitted from furniture, paint, carpets and other items.</span></p>
<p><span>As a very robust plant, it adapts well to all indoor conditions and is therefore also suitable for people with less green thumbs.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important, however, that plants are not the only solution for good air quality. Regular ventilation and reducing sources of air pollutants also play a role. Nevertheless, plants can make a positive contribution and promote a healthy, pleasant environment. Last but not least, they are a natural and cost-effective method of optimizing the indoor climate.</span></p>
