                <p>Human hearing is a complex and fascinating sensory organ that allows us to connect and interact with our surroundings. It allows us to hear voices, enjoy music and warns us of danger.</p>
<p>Hearing loss, whether gradual or sudden, can significantly impair our connection to the world around us and presents those affected with major challenges in their daily lives. However, it's not just about the ability to hear sounds and speech.</p>
<p>Hearing loss can also affect social life, mental health and overall quality of life. People with hearing loss often report a feeling of isolation, difficulty communicating and reduced participation in social life.</p>
<p>In this context, Feng Shui and Chinese medicine offer alternative and complementary approaches to not only make life with hearing loss easier, but also enrich it.</p>
<p>These ancient wisdoms, deeply rooted in the harmony between people and the environment, offer holistic methods to strengthen physical and mental balance and promote well-being.</p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Feng Shui and its relationship to the element of water</h2>
<p>In the ancient Chinese teaching of Feng Shui, the element of water plays a central and symbolic role. Water, as one of the five basic elements, is believed to have a deep connection to our sensory organs, particularly the ears.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese philosophy, water represents not only physical qualities such as flow and adaptability, but also deeper, metaphorical meanings such as wisdom, depth and calm.</p>
<p>For people living with hearing loss, these qualities are particularly important. Water symbolizes the ability to adapt to change and flow in harmony with the environment. These characteristics can be particularly useful for dealing with the challenges and changes that accompany hearing loss.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Hoerverlust-und-Feng-Shui-2-1024x685.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The element of water is well used</h2>
<p>The integration of water elements in the Feng Shui living room and workspace can be done in a variety of ways. A classic example is a small indoor fountain. The gentle sound of water can have a calming effect while symbolizing the constant flow and adaptability that is so important when dealing with hearing loss.</p>
<p>It's not just about the physical presence of water, but also what it represents: a continuous flow of energy and harmony.</p>
<p>In addition, images of water landscapes, such as oceans, rivers or lakes, can be used in the design of rooms. These images serve not only as aesthetic elements, but also as visual reminders of the fluidity and adaptability that water symbolizes.</p>
<p>Such depictions can help promote a sense of calm and inner peace, which can be particularly valuable for people with hearing loss.</p>
<p>The practice of Feng Shui is about creating and maintaining a balance between the different elements. Consciously incorporating the water element into the design of our living spaces can help create a harmonious balance that supports well-being. This is particularly important in rooms where relaxation and calm are to be encouraged. Particular attention should be paid to the Feng Shui bedroom .</p>
<p>Ultimately, using the water element in Feng Shui is about creating an environment that is both physically and emotionally supportive. For people with hearing loss, this can make a significant contribution to improving their quality of life by helping them find inner peace and better adapt to the challenges of everyday life.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Room design according to Feng Shui to promote harmony</h2>
<p>Interior design according to the principles of Feng Shui is not just a question of aesthetic taste, but rather a tool to increase well-being and quality of life. This is especially true for people who face challenges such as hearing loss. A carefully designed environment can be instrumental in promoting balance and inner harmony.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><strong>Harmonious furniture arrangement:</strong> The placement of the furniture should be chosen so that it allows an unhindered flow of energy ( Qi ). It is important to create an inviting and open atmosphere, especially in rooms that are used for relaxation and communication. This can be achieved by arranging furniture in a way that promotes both privacy and community. Particular attention should be paid to the Feng Shui living room and the Feng Shui bedroom .</li>
<li><strong>Color choice for a calming atmosphere: </strong>Colors play an important role in creating a harmonious environment. Soft tones such as blue and green are known to have a calming and relaxing effect. These colors can promote mental calm and help alleviate the emotional challenges associated with hearing loss.</li>
<li><strong>Natural elements and plants:</strong> Incorporating natural elements such as plants or natural materials can strengthen the connection to nature and increase well-being. Plants not only add aesthetics, but also improve air quality and promote a feeling of vibrancy and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced lighting:</strong> Well-thought-out lighting that includes both natural and artificial light can positively influence mood. Soft, indirect light creates a pleasant atmosphere that can be both relaxing and energizing.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chinese medicine and its perspective on hearing loss</h2>
<p>Chinese medicine offers a holistic approach to treating hearing loss by viewing it in the context of the entire body and its energy flows. This approach goes beyond the symptoms and addresses the causes and underlying energetic imbalances.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Herbal therapy</h3>
<p>Various herbs are used in traditional Chinese medicine to support and strengthen hearing. From the perspective of Chinese medicine, the kidneys are also affected by hearing loss. These herbs can help improve blood circulation, reduce inflammation, strengthen the kidneys, and restore overall energetic balance. Alternative treatment methods should also be discussed with your doctor.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Acupuncture</h3>
<p>Acupuncture is a well-known method of Chinese medicine that involves placing fine needles at specific points on the body to regulate and harmonize the flow of energy. If you have hearing loss, acupuncture can help clear the underlying energetic blockages and support the function of the ear.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Qi Gong and Tai Chi</h3>
<p>These gentle forms of movement help to harmonize and strengthen the flow of energy in the body. Regular practice can improve overall well-being and reduce stress to lessen the effects of hearing loss.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nutritional advice</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine places great emphasis on a balanced diet to promote health. Specific foods and dietary recommendations can help support ear health and improve overall well-being.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Integration of modern technologies and traditional wisdom</h2>
<p>It can be said that both Feng Shui and Chinese medicine offer valuable and enriching approaches to supporting life with hearing loss.</p>
<p>They help strengthen the balance between body and mind and promote a deep understanding of the importance of harmony and balance in our daily lives. These ancient traditions can teach us how to adapt our environment and behavior to achieve greater levels of well-being, despite the challenges that come with hearing loss.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should not underestimate the importance of modern technologies, especially hearing aids.</p>
<p>They offer significant help with hearing loss and can significantly improve quality of life.</p>
<p>Hearing aids enable people with hearing impairments to communicate more effectively, participate in social life and fully enjoy the joys of everyday life. In addition, hearing aid prices are reasonable and the costs are subsidized accordingly by health insurance, so you don't have to worry and everyone can have access to appropriate hearing aid.</p>
<p>Combining technological solutions such as hearing aids with the holistic approaches of Feng Shui and Chinese medicine represents a comprehensive strategy to address the challenges of hearing loss.</p>
<p>Through this integrative approach – combining modern technology with ancient wisdom – people with hearing loss can lead balanced and fulfilling lives. She encourages us to look both outward to technological solutions and inward to personal growth and harmony. This creates a holistic path that encompasses and enriches the most diverse aspects of life with hearing loss.</p>

                <p><span>Feng Shui is one of the oldest Chinese teachings that deals with harmony between people and their living environment. If you want to align your living space according to this theory, the price is not important when choosing decorations and pieces of furniture.</span></p>
<p><span>Look out for good offers and deals, which you can </span><span>find on My Deal,</span><span> for example . The correct alignment of decorative elements and furniture is independent of the price. We have some great savings tips for you on how to bring Feng Shui into your home and save money in the process.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Furnishing according to Feng Shui – the most important tips without high costs</span></h2>
<p><span>Designing your rooms according to Feng Shui doesn't cost you any money at first. By considering the basics of Chinese teachings, you are already contributing to a harmonious living environment. The perfect locations for furnishings can be calculated </span><span>using well-known Feng Shui formulas</span><span> . Regardless of the zone or room, consider the following basic tips for the perfect result:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Light is desired:</span></strong><span> In order to let life into your rooms, you need light. Keep the curtains open during the day, use light colors and combine islands of light in each room.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Choose materials:</span></strong><span> To stimulate the flow of Qi, use mirrors and glasses. They are used as wind chimes, candlesticks or </span><span>decorative bowls</span><span> . For calming zones, you use wood and natural stone that fit harmoniously into the surroundings.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Keep things organized:</span></strong><span> Shelves and cupboards with closed doors contribute to more structure and order. Avoid an excess of decorations, but rather rely on cleverly placed highlights.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Consider the seasons:</span></strong><span> Change your accessories depending on the season. In spring, fresh flowers symbolize the arrival of new energy, in winter you can bring harmony and idyll home with a flower arrangement.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Integrate plants:</span></strong><span> The free window area poses the risk of losing Qi. Place plants on the windowsill to keep Qi in the room and support Chinese teachings.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Use Feng Shui in every room - it can be done without high costs</span></h2>
<p><span>Feng </span><span>Shui is used in work rooms</span><span> as well as in </span><span>Feng Shui living rooms</span><span> and </span><span>Feng Shui bedrooms</span><span> . Basically, you won't incur any extra costs if you furnish your house according to the teachings of Feng Shui. We have put together some basic tips for every room that won't break your budget and still bring the art of Feng Shui into your home.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your bedroom</span></h3>
<p><span>Save on decorative items</span><span> in this place to keep the energy flowing. Minimalist furnishing styles are very popular; when choosing colors, pay attention to soft tones for Qi, peace and coziness. Order is crucial for the flow of Qi. Use closed cupboards and let clutter disappear.</span></p>
<p><span>Mirrors have no place in the bedroom because they create inner turmoil. Instead, decorate your walls with photos of your loved ones. It's not expensive and at the same time provides a pleasant feeling of coziness. Electrical devices are absolutely taboo in your bedroom. </span><span>Electrosmog affects your sleep</span><span> and imbalances the Qi.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your study</span></h3>
<p><span>Once you have set up your home office at home, the desk is very important. Make sure you look directly at the door when you sit at your place of work. The windows should be on the opposite side of your strong hand. If you are left-handed, the window to your right is in the right place. By working with your back to the wall, the Qi can flow optimally through the room and give you the energy you need.</span></p>
<p><span>Remove clocks and calendars as decorative elements from your study, as they unconsciously create pressure. Instead, rely on green plants. They give your room harmony and contribute to an optimal indoor climate. As in the living room, the center of the room should remain free. You place electrical devices against the wall, keeping the best possible distance from your desk.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-kostenguenstig-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> is the place of regular transformations. Here you transform raw food into meals. A high flow of Qi is important, so use natural elements when furnishing. When choosing your worktop, graphite and wood are well suited as raw materials. Compare prices online and look out for discounts to save money.</span></p>
<p><span>If you work in the kitchen, your gaze should be towards the door if possible. The choice of dining table (if you have enough space) is very important. Round and oval tables allow for better communication strategies; the Qi intersects at square tables. The placement of the knives is particularly important. Avoid knife blocks as they pose a danger to Qi. To safely store the sharp blades, choose a closed drawer.</span></p>
<p><span>Water and fire are the two central elements in the kitchen and they do not harmonize with each other. Place the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher away from the stove and oven to incorporate a safe distance. Red, green, cream and white are considered suitable </span><span>colors</span><span> for the kitchen. Natural elements such as stone and wood fit very well.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The rules for your living room</span></h3>
<p><span>The </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> is the perfect place for mirrors. This expands your view and ensures an optical increase in size. To save money, buy your mirrors second hand or browse a flea market. Maybe your neighbors, friends or grandparents also have decorative mirrors in the basement that they would like to pass on to you for a small amount of money.</span></p>
<p><span>To prevent Qi blockages, keep doors open in the living room. If you want to integrate a privacy screen, airy and loose curtains are suitable for the door frames. The most important rules also include a free middle. Avoid furniture in the middle of the room, otherwise the Qi cannot flow into all corners of the room.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a warm atmosphere at the same time, cover the floor in the middle of the room with light, warm carpets. Look for bargains and special offers to save your budget.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Feng Shui doesn’t have to be expensive – buy your furnishings cheaply!</span></h2>
<p><span>The teachings of Feng Shui do not dictate how expensive your furniture and decorations have to be. Instead, it is primarily about the type of furnishings, the use of appropriate colors and the placement of furniture.</span></p>
<p><span>Theoretically, you can set up an apartment suitable for Feng Shui using your existing furniture. You may just need to replace individual elements. Closed cupboards are better than open shelves, round coffee and dining tables promote communication.</span></p>
<p><span>In the age of the Internet, you have many opportunities to save money when buying furniture. Take advantage of deals, offers and discounts so you spend less money on your facility. Also compare prices, because not every dealer is actually cheaper. To live according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> , you don't need a lot of money. What is more important is the willingness to rearrange your rooms and thus ensure optimal Qi flow.</span></p>

                <p><span>Sustainability is a topic that is becoming increasingly important in society. It therefore does not ignore people who want to furnish their rooms according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> or have already furnished them. The question for them is how Feng Shui and sustainability aspects can be reconciled. A common consideration is investing in a solar system, as this brings with it numerous advantages. However, </span><span>negative effects such as electrosmog</span><span> are often feared. It is therefore worth taking a closer look at the topic so that you can make the best decision for your individual case.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How are Feng Shui and sustainability related?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Feng Shui plays an important role for more and more people when they build a house or furnish their apartment. Nevertheless, they also have to take other aspects into account, for example legal requirements, financial aspects or sustainability.</span></p>
<p><span>Solar systems are becoming increasingly popular as a way to make a valuable contribution to the fight against climate change and to become independent of network operators and rising costs. There are not only financial arguments in favor of a photovoltaic system on the roof, but also financial ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Modern systems can now be installed on a variety of different roofs, which is why it is definitely worth getting professional advice, clarifying the individual options and </span><span>realistically calculating</span><span> the costs for the solar system . The only question that remains is whether and to what extent such a PV system on the roof also affects Feng Shui, even though it is not really visible or noticeable inside the house?</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, Feng Shui and sustainability are closely related, so that an influence of the solar system on the interior of the rooms or the well-being in them cannot be ruled out with certainty.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, Feng Shui is about the flow of energy, which can be promoted through natural design but can also be disrupted by influences such as electrosmog. It is also recommended to choose elements that are as natural as possible, which a solar system cannot achieve, at least at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span>However, it corresponds to another Feng Shui principle: a sustainable environment has a positive effect on mental and physical health. A design according to Feng Shui and a solar system on the roof can therefore complement each other perfectly, but the combination also brings with it some stumbling blocks that need to be known and taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Electrosmog from solar systems – is the fear justified?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>At best, a solar system should not disrupt the appearance and functionality of your own four walls. Since it is located outside the field of vision, this is usually not a problem indoors. This aspect needs to be given more consideration when designing outdoor areas. But according to Feng Shui, a photovoltaic system can also cause disruptions inside, namely </span><span>through potential electrosmog</span><span> .</span></p>
<p><span>In principle, solar panels have no negative impact on well-being or the flow of energy in your own home, as they fit harmoniously into the roof.</span></p>
<p><span>There are always discussions only with regard to electric fields. In order to realistically evaluate this influence, it is worth finding out about the technology in the PV modules: The electricity is generated in the form of direct current, i.e. a magnetic constant field is created, which causes significantly fewer problems with regard to electrosmog than a direct current Alternating field.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, electricity production does not take place permanently, but only when there is sufficient sunlight and therefore only during the day. There is therefore no need to worry about sleep disorders caused by electrosmog caused by a PV generator.</span></p>
<p><span>Other influences include the size of the system, the extent of electricity production and the types of inverters.</span></p>
<p><span>The bottom line is that the problem with electrosmog in solar systems is significantly smaller than is often assumed. However, the fear is not completely unfounded, because sooner or later the direct current generated must of course be converted into grid-compliant alternating current and this happens in the so-called inverter. This can lead to the already mentioned, more critical alternating magnetic fields, regardless of the time of day or night.</span></p>

<p><span>Grounding the module field is then the most effective and at the same time simplest solution.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Pay attention to earth radiation</span></h2>
<p><mark class="has-inline-color has-black-color"><span>Systems on residential building roofs should only be considered in conjunction with so-called earth radiation shielding, as otherwise considerable additional stress can arise from reflections. Both photovoltaic and solar systems as well as thermal insulation in the roof, which consist of glass wool with aluminum foil, cause large-scale radiation reflections due to their metallized surfaces. This leads to increased radiation exposure in the rooms on the upper floor. These reflections can only be avoided by using a shielding coating, for example in the basement or on the floor.</span></mark></p>
<p><strong><span>Make sure there is enough space between the modules and rooms used during the day.</span></strong></p>
<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><span>Grounding the modules is essential.</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid the formation of large conductor loops.</span></p>
<p><span>Use shielded, grounded string lines or place them in grounded pipes.</span></p>
<p><span>Position the inverter as far away as possible from permanent places such as your bed or your office workstation.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Tips to avoid electrosmog caused by photovoltaics</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The fact is that solar systems can create electrosmog, just like all other electronic devices in your home. However, this danger is much smaller than is often assumed and there are simple solutions to minimize electrosmog or – better yet – completely prevent it. Here are some helpful tips so that you don't have to miss out on the advantages of a photovoltaic system, but can still furnish your home according to Feng Shui and protect it from electrosmog:</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>1. </span><strong><span>Ground the module field.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>As you already know, it makes sense to ground the module field of the solar system in order to minimize or completely eliminate electrosmog. It is worth speaking to an experienced expert about this in order to integrate the PV system into your own home right from the start so that it does not become an energy disruptive factor. Such grounding or dissipation may also be useful for other components to minimize electromagnetic interference and ensure that it is dissipated properly.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>2. </span><strong><span>Separate the PV generator and the living spaces.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>It also makes sense to install the generator as far as possible from the rooms where you spend the most time. The more distance possible, the better. If in doubt, it is better to position it near the rooms in which you stay at night rather than those that are your main place of residence during the day - since the solar system does not work at night.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>3. </span><strong><span>Avoid conductor loops if possible.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Conductor loops are also</span><span> a common cause of electrosmog from electronic devices . They should therefore only be used in the smallest possible number and in the smallest possible size, for example as lightning protection for the solar system.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>4. </span><strong><span>Make sure there is good shielding.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>If the distance between the solar system and the living room or bedroom is too short so that you fear energy disruptions caused by electrosmog, additional shielding may make sense. There are special shielding materials and colors available that can help reduce electrosmog. So find out whether these paints and materials are available and useful in your individual case to block potential electromagnetic radiation.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>5. </span><strong><span>Invest in special cabling.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Shielding also makes sense for the cabling, as this often has points of contact with the living spaces and is therefore also a potential source of electrosmog. The cables and technology should therefore be shielded with suitable materials, which is why professional advice is worthwhile before laying.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>6. </span><strong><span>Take regular EMF measurements.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>If you are still unsure whether the solar system and its components are causing electrosmog in your home, </span><span>regular EMF measurements</span><span> are a good idea . Special EMF measuring devices help monitor exposure to electromagnetic fields and take countermeasures if necessary. Furthermore, an electrical installation specialist or a special EMF expert can provide a professional assessment of the situation and help prevent electrosmog from the solar system.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>7. </span><strong><span>Combat electrosmog through frequency management.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Combating electrosmog with electronic devices doesn't sound very effective at first glance. However, there are now special technologies that control radio frequencies and can thereby minimize electromagnetic pollution. It is therefore worthwhile to at least inform yourself about the options and check to what extent their use in your four walls makes sense.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>8. </span><strong><span>The solar system should be checked regularly.</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Finally, it can happen that electrosmog only arises over time when the solar system is damaged, the shielding materials become brittle or malfunctions occur. Regular inspection and maintenance of the PV system is therefore essential - these are often already included in the services of the provider who also carries out the installation.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In summary, there is nothing wrong with installing a solar system on the roof if you have designed your apartment or house according to Feng Shui. However, it is important to inform yourself about the special features described and to take appropriate measures to prevent or minimize electrosmog. Then you can make optimal use of the advantages of your own PV system without having to worry about energy or other disadvantages - for a life in harmony with Feng Shui and sustainability.</span></p>

                    <p><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/17/Feng-Shui-Sitzen-320x213.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Feng Shui Secrets: Discover the art of ideal furniture placement for ultimate seating pleasure!" /></p>
                <p><span>Most people spend a significant portion of their waking hours sitting. </span><span>Depending on the scientific source,</span><span> we spend between 8.5 and even 11.5 hours per day in a sitting position.</span></p>
<p><span>We sit at work, in the car or on public transport, at meals and during our evening leisure activities in front of the television or reading. On average, the time spent sitting or lying down is less, which does not have a positive long-term effect on health and well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes it all the more important to design sitting in such a way that it promotes health and well-being or at least does not have a negative impact. In addition to the diverse ergonomic aspects that scientific findings require to be taken into account, Feng Shui can also make a valuable contribution to healthy sitting. Positioning seating furniture according to Feng Shui can have a positive influence on the flow of energy and thus bring many good changes into your life. This means that even long periods of sitting can become a feel-good experience.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The living room as the energy center of the apartment</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In Feng Shui, the </span><span>living room</span><span> is often referred to as the lungs of the house or apartment. Just as the lungs distribute the breath of life throughout the body, Qi also flows from the living room into all living areas.</span></p>
<p><span>In most households, sitting is the predominant posture in the living room. We sit comfortably on the sofa or in armchairs when we are entertained by the television, read a good book, do handicrafts or are engrossed in good conversations. Comfortable seating with a feel-good factor is therefore essential in this central room.</span></p>
<p><span>For most people, the sofa is the centerpiece of a cozy </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> . The positioning of this piece of furniture should therefore be done with care. The sofa also receives special attention in Feng Shui.</span></p>
<p><span>While the trend in modern living concepts is to position furniture primarily along the walls, according to Feng Shui, the sofa is unthinkable without a solid wall behind it.</span></p>
<p><span>The cozy heart of your living room should find its place with the entire backrest against a protective wall. This conveys security and security and fulfills a primal human need that goes back to our very first relatives in prehistoric times.</span></p>
<p><span>When people still lived in caves, it was important for their survival never to have the cave entrance behind them, but rather to entrust this unprotected side to a stable wall.</span></p>
<p><span>The focus was on the opening of the cave in order to be able to identify dangers early. This genetic program accompanies us to this day and also finds its place in Feng Shui. With your back against the protective wall, the view from the sofa is directed towards the doors and windows and thus conveys security and security in your personal comfort zone.</span></p>
<p><span>When the subconscious feels protection, the mind can calm down and is free to devote itself to creative and energetic thoughts.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting at the desk according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>The desk is an area in which concentration and performance, creative energy and inventiveness are of great importance in everyday life. Especially at a time when the home desk has become more of a focus in professional areas, the design of this living area should be done consciously.</span></p>
<p><span>In the </span><span>Feng Shui workplace,</span><span> the positioning of the desk and office chair is crucial for the flow of energy and a free mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Similar to the sofa, the workplace should also be positioned so that there is a stable, protective wall behind it. This conveys security and thereby releases mental capacities that can be used for creativity and creativity.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are windows, glass elements as doors or walls, passageways or open space at the back, this can subconsciously cause constant unrest.</span></p>
<p><span>The body and mind remain in a tense and alert state and can prevent creative energy from flowing freely.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also not helpful if the front of the desk is directly in front of a wall.</span></p>
<p><span>This external blockage can also block thoughts and internal energy and limit thought processes.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, a clear view across the room is stimulating. A look out of the window can tempt people who tend to dream to wander all too easily and lose focus on what is important.</span></p>
<p><span>Here you should listen to yourself and find out what type of thinker you are and what environment is particularly good for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The office chair and desk should also meet ergonomic guidelines. If physical blockages arise due to an unhealthy posture when sitting for long periods of time at work, this also affects the flow of Qi and can significantly limit the ability to concentrate and perform.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Feng Shui in the dining room: Promote the flow of energy during meals</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In order to consciously enjoy a meal and support the digestive system, we should take time and sit down to eat. Whether in the dining area at home, in the canteen or in a restaurant, a mindfully designed area for meals can make a valuable contribution to well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining area plays a central role in everyday life. This is where the family comes together to exchange ideas and lovely people meet to enjoy themselves and have lively conversations. The dining room can also be used to reflect on the day's events in order to process them and clear the mind. This energy should also be reflected in the room design.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining area is best placed near the center of the apartment or house. The direct proximity to the </span><span>Feng Shui kitchen</span><span> or the Feng Shui living room supports the energy that flows there.</span></p>
<p><span>In modern living concepts, the dining room is often no longer a separate room, but is integrated into the kitchen or living room. This means that meals can benefit from the energy flow there, as long as it is used consciously.</span></p>
<p><span>The dining table with sufficient seating for the people living in the household and guests is the center of the dining room.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike the sofa in the living room, it can also be placed in the room without requiring protective walls on all sides. At the dining table, however, it depends on where the view falls from the different seating positions.</span></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Seating should be arranged so that people at the table can see each other without hindrance.</span></h3>
<p><span>This promotes communication and a feeling of connection.</span></p>
<p><span>High elements on the table top, such as towering plant arrangements, should therefore be avoided. The same applies to large and low-hanging lamps.</span></p>
<p><span>If possible, all seats should be arranged so that none of them are in the direct line between a window and a door. Looking directly at the bathroom or toilet door or the front door of the house or apartment also creates unrest and can disrupt the flow of energy.</span></p>
<p><span>If appropriate positioning cannot be avoided, a curtain or screen can be a flexible design aid and give the dining area its harmonious effect.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to chairs, the focus is on comfort. Nevertheless, they should not have excessive padding. A sufficiently high and wide backrest ensures seating comfort even during extended meals together and also suggests the protection and security that is achieved, for example, on a sofa by a solid wall in the back.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>Sitting on the balcony and terrace or in the garden</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>It's not just indoors that we spend many hours sitting. If you have a terrace, balcony or garden in your private area, you can also set up a cozy seating area there and thus create an additional living area that is close to nature and therefore particularly energetically appealing.</span></p>
<p><span>The rules of Feng Shui can also make an important contribution to more energy in life outdoors. The energy and Qi are channeled from the garden to the house. An </span><span>outdoor area designed according to Feng Shui</span><span> essentially determines how much energy can reach the domestic area and whether it can flow there undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span>The furniture used in an outdoor seating area should reflect the natural character in terms of look and feel.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/wittekind_lounge-4er-sofa_header_01-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p><span>Wood is the preferred material that has these natural properties, does not heat up too much even in strong sunlight and can absorb and continue the energy of plants and trees. The </span><span>furniture manufacturer WITTEKIND</span><span> designs comfortable yet discreet outdoor lounge furniture made from sustainable wood that fits harmoniously into the energy flow of the Feng Shui garden.</span></p>

                <p><span>Plants play an important role in Feng Shui. Ultimately, in practice, Feng Shui aims to promote harmonious energies in rooms. Plants have also been proven to improve air quality and thus ensure greater well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>Plants in the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> are a special case . As already explained, humans and plants compete to a certain extent for oxygen at night. During the day, plants carry out photosynthesis. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span>This process is driven by daylight. Without light, this photosynthesis cannot take place. Instead, plants absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night. This process is called cellular respiration, an exchange of gases that occurs at a much lower rate than photosynthesis during the day.</span></p>
<p><span>In a normally ventilated room where plants are located, there is no risk of people and plants competing for oxygen. So there is no reason to ban plants from the bedroom. On the contrary. In </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> plants are also viewed as living sources of energy, which not least have a symbolic meaning for growth and harmony. They help attract and spread positive Qi energies.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>About colors and shapes of flower pots</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>We have already talked about the selection of plants. But it's not just the plant itself that matters, but also the material and color of the flower pots and their placement in the bedroom. With a </span><span>flower pot from pflanzenwerk.de,</span><span> every plant can be optimally showcased.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>color</span><span> of the flower pots can have a decisive influence on the energetic balance in the room. Terracotta, brown and yellow represent the earth element and create a warm atmosphere. These colors are well suited for rooms or areas that require calm and stability.</span></p>
<p><span>Green tones give a room a lively atmosphere and should be chosen carefully for the bedroom. This also applies to white, silver or metallic colors.</span></p>
<p><span>Blue and black, on the other hand, represent the water element in Feng Shui and can </span><span>bring a calming, flowing energy into the room</span><span> . Flower pots in these colors are ideal for rooms that are intended to promote relaxation and recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>The shapes of flower pots also have an energetic impact on the room. Round and oval flower pots create a calm, relaxed atmosphere. They are often used in the bedroom to support positive energy and create a pleasant environment.</span></p>
<p><span>The size of the flower pots is also important. If the pots are too small or too large in relation to the surrounding area, they can affect the energetic balance. Therefore, the size of the flower pots should be based on the size of the room and not have a dominating effect.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>The right locations</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>In order to create a harmonious environment, the placement of the flower pots in the bedroom is also important. Sharp corners or pointed edges should always be avoided near the bed to prevent negative energy.</span></p>
<p><span>The room must be well ventilated to allow positive circulation of Qi, the vital life energy, in </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . Effective ventilation not only promotes the free flow of Qi, but also supports a harmonious distribution of energy throughout the room.</span></p>
<p><span>In classical Feng Shui, specific areas of a room are considered according to the cardinal directions, with the placement of flower pots and other decorative elements strategically chosen to promote the balance of the five elements. This helps create a positive atmosphere and strengthens the energetic balance in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>Feng Shui emphasizes that any object, including a flower pot, has an energetic influence on the space. It is recommended that these items should be kept in perfect condition.</span></p>
<p><span>An intact and well-loved flower pot not only enhances the aesthetic beauty of the room, but also contributes positively to the energy quality. In the spirit of Feng Shui, the condition and care of each individual object is viewed as a reflection of the soul. It is therefore advisable to handle the objects consciously, to care for them and to care for them in order to create a positive and supportive atmosphere.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>It's all about caring for the plants</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>Of course, proper care of the plants is also crucial for well-being and the atmosphere in the bedroom. To do this, you need to understand the needs of the respective plant species. Every plant has different requirements for light, water and nutrients.</span></p>
<p><span>Some plants need a lot of sunlight, others are happy with less. The plants I suggested, jasmine, ivy, lucky feather and money tree, tolerate a wide variety of lighting conditions and also feel quite comfortable in shady locations. The optimal temperature is 18 degrees, which is just right for the bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span>These plants do not like direct sunlight, and they have something else in common: they </span><span>cannot tolerate waterlogging</span><span> . That's why you should water the plants in the bedroom regularly, but not excessively, and remove excess water from the planters. To promote the health of the plant, it is also important to always remove dead leaves immediately and occasionally shorten the plant slightly so that it does not grow excessively.</span></p>
<p><span>Careful care of your plants is particularly important in the bedroom because they are intended to provide a calming backdrop. Just the sight of well-cared for plants can reduce stress and improve your mood. Therefore, pay regular attention to the plants. Then they not only represent a decorative element, but also support a restful and harmonious night's sleep.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span>How many plants should there be?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span>As I said, you should use plants sparingly in the bedroom. But how many plants are actually necessary to have a positive effect on the indoor climate? In fact, studies have shown that just a few plants can improve indoor air quality. Experts recommend placing at least one plant per 10 square meters of room space.</span></p>
<p><span>Among the particularly effective plants is the ivy. It is known for its ability to absorb airborne pollutants emitted from furniture, paint, carpets and other items.</span></p>
<p><span>As a very robust plant, it adapts well to all indoor conditions and is therefore also suitable for people with less green thumbs.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important, however, that plants are not the only solution for good air quality. Regular ventilation and reducing sources of air pollutants also play a role. Nevertheless, plants can make a positive contribution and promote a healthy, pleasant environment. Last but not least, they are a natural and cost-effective method of optimizing the indoor climate.</span></p>

<p><span>Each material carries its own energy and influences the atmosphere of your living space. Wood radiates growth and vitality, stone conveys grounding and calming, while ceramic promotes harmony and stability. By incorporating these materials into your home, you harness their specific energies to create an environment that is not only visually appealing but also energetically balanced.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>How can you integrate wood, stone and ceramics into your home? </span></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><span>Wood brings growth and vitality to every room. Incorporate this element through wooden tables, shelves, floors or decorative elements such as picture frames and sculptures to enhance the wood energy.</span></li>
<li><span>Stone has a grounding effect and can be integrated both inside and outside. Use stone slabs, granite countertops, or marble vases to enhance the grounding energy in your home. Water features such as small fountains further promote harmony.</span></li>
<li><span>Ceramics promote harmony and stability. You can create a pleasant atmosphere by using ceramic tiles, pottery or artistic vases.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>When choosing materials, it is important that they are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also sustainable and environmentally friendly. You are actively contributing to protecting the earth. Pay attention to the tactile qualities of the materials: the feeling of smooth wood, rough stone and fine ceramics under your fingertips can significantly enrich the feeling of living.</span></p>
<p><span>Through this conscious selection and placement of materials, you can create an environment that is both aesthetically pleasing and energetically balanced.<br></span></p>

<p><span>When choosing furniture in Feng Shui, it is therefore essential not only to consider design and material, but also to take dimensions into account. Furniture that adheres to the principles of Feng Shui supports and enhances the positive energy flows within your home. This helps create an environment that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also energetically balanced.</span></p>
<p><span>By consciously applying these principles, you can transform your home into a real place of power!</span></p>
<p><span>My final thoughts: Create a home full of harmony and energy.</span></p>
<p><span>The correct selection and placement of furniture, the use of harmonizing colors and shapes as well as a deep understanding of the energetic effects of materials play a crucial role. Not only can you improve the aesthetic appearance of your living space, but you can also increase your general well-being. These elements help create an environment that is more than just visually appealing - it becomes a source of positive energy.</span></p>

                <p><span>Clothes make the man – that’s a famous saying. In fact, the way we dress has a lot to do with our own self-image and the image we want to convey to others. Clothing always works on two levels: internally and externally.</span></p>
<p><span>But in addition to the visual effect, what we wear is also said to have an energetic effect. It is therefore quite interesting to take a closer look at the topic of clothing and think about whether and to what extent your choice of clothing actually reflects you - or how you can improve it according to </span><span>Feng Shui .</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2><span>View clothing as a reflection of your personality</span></h2>
<p><span>Many people carelessly follow one trend after another. They follow what styles are currently popular with friends, in magazines or on the Internet and imitate the outfits of their fashion role models.</span></p>
<p><span>Others don't worry about their clothes at all. They simply wear the discarded clothes of siblings or friends. The main thing is cheap and comfortable, is their motto. However, the appearance plays a subordinate role for them.</span></p>
<h3><span>There is no “right” or “wrong” when dealing with clothing.</span></h3>
<p><span>After all, everyone is allowed to wear what he or she likes - and that's a good thing. In many other countries around the world this is not (yet) a given.</span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, it can be interesting to question your personal approach to clothing. This reveals a lot about you and what is important to you in life. If you're always following trends, you may not have found your own look yet - in a figurative sense, you haven't yet found yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, people who have little to no concern for their appearance may tend not to take themselves seriously enough. They are not worth buying new shoes or an expensive trip to the hairdresser.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, they may have developed a habit of always putting other people, such as their </span><span>children,</span><span> before themselves - even if </span><span>their altruism</span><span> comes at the expense of their own well-being or even health.</span></p>

<h2><span>Clothing is part of your personality development</span></h2>
<p><span>These are just a few examples of many, but they already make it clear to what extent clothing can be a reflection of your personality. Every person has different reasons why they approach the topic of outfits or styling in a certain way. It can therefore be interesting to examine your own motives.</span></p>
<p><span>As superficial as the topic may seem at first glance, it is profound at second glance. Because you will quickly notice how your clothing style changes as your personality matures. Suddenly you might feel confident wearing bolder </span><span>colors</span><span> because you've gained more self-confidence. Or the extra self-love finally allows you to treat yourself to new clothes every now and then and reward yourself for a stressful everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span>Clothes may not make you a different person, but you can also have an effect on the inside: a new hairdresser might give you more self-acceptance or the new jeans in the perfect fit will make a few pounds appear visually and give you self-confidence and the courage to do so upcoming presentation.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Here too the list of examples is long. The fact is: internal and external changes go hand in hand. You can't just change something on one level without feeling an effect on the other levels - be it internally, optically, spiritually, externally or energetically.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2><span>Sustainability</span></h2>
<p><span>In addition to clothing, bags can also be wonderfully printed and given away as merchandise or sold. More and more people are paying attention to their own sustainability, and jute bags are just as important to use here. </span></p>
<p><span>They are also used every day and are therefore free advertising space. You can easily </span><span>have jute bags printed</span><span> online and then distribute them to employees and customers. You can also fill them with other goodies for an even better promotional effect. At the same time, reusable bags always do something for the environment, so it's a win-win for everyone.</span></p>
<div><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span>
<h2><span>The connection between clothing and Feng Shui</span></h2>
<p><span>Long story short: There is a direct connection between your choice of clothing and your personality. You will probably always find yourself sorting people into “pigeons” based on their external appearance.</span></p>
<p><span>The man with the long hair and the band shirt probably likes going to heavy metal concerts and the woman in the perfectly fitting business suit is career-oriented.</span></p>
<p><span>Such conclusions from the outside to the inside are completely natural - but that doesn't mean that they are always true. But this hasty judgment is a natural mechanism in the brain and you will then subconsciously do everything you can to confirm </span><span>your first impression again and again.</span></p>
<p><span>Your choice of clothing largely determines how you appear to other people - but also to yourself. And this is exactly where </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> can come into play. This special form is often referred to as Body Feng Shui.</span></p>
<span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span>
<h2><span>What is behind the term “Body Feng Shui”?</span></h2>
<p><span>When it comes to Feng Shui,  </span><span>the focus is on the living spaces</span><span> . However, the teaching can also be applied to many other areas of life - for example health. Body Feng Shui is a continuation of </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> and primarily looks at the impact of clothing on your self-image, well-being, your personality and your life in general.</span></p>
<p><span>In Body Feng Shui, clothing is also viewed as a kind of </span><span>space</span><span> that surrounds you like a second skin. Strictly speaking, the clothes are much closer to you than the actual room, which could be viewed as a third skin, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span>Body Feng Shui is all about well-being in your own body, which includes not only clothing but also your own weight and physical performance. Clothes are not the only important factor in body feng shui, but also your health in general or internal thought patterns and beliefs. But in addition to working on the inside, you can also work on your “second skin” here – your external appearance.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2><span>What are the goals of clothing according to Feng Shui?</span></h2>
<p><span>According to Feng Shui</span><span> , working on your appearance does n't mean going to a plastic surgeon or spending a lot of money on cosmetics or going to the hairdresser. Instead, it's about creating a “feel-good space” for yourself through the right styling, which has a positive effect on your well-being, for example through more self-confidence or simply coziness.</span></p>
<p><span>Because the feeling of a warm and fluffy sweater in winter, the cozy sneakers that carry you lightly through life, or the hat that gives you a feeling of security - they all increase your well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>Clothing can therefore be a comfort zone. It protects you from danger, keeps you warm on cold days and determines how your body feels. It therefore creates a strong energetic effect.</span></p>
<h2><span>A look at the energetic effect of clothes</span></h2>
<p><span>If clothing is viewed based on the </span><span>teachings of Feng Shui</span><span> , the same rules apply to it as to </span><span>rooms</span><span> . Because as you already know, your clothes represent, so to speak, the smallest room in which you find yourself. It is therefore important to choose </span><span>the colors</span><span> , fabrics and cuts carefully. Similar rooms are the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> , the Feng Shui living room, the </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span></p>
<p><span>On the one hand, the visual appearance determines the energetic effect your clothing has on you and those around you. On the other hand, as already mentioned, clothing also largely influences your well-being and therefore </span><span>your body language</span><span> and your energetic charisma.</span></p>
<h4><span>To clarify, use the following example:</span></h4>
<p><span>For example, if you wear clothing that is too tight, uncomfortable shoes, or heavy jewelry around your neck, you may feel uncomfortable in your skin. You adopt a crouched and stiff posture, walk unsteadily or breathe heavily. This not only affects your well-being, but also your impact on other people.</span></p>
<p><span>With the right or wrong clothing, you can actively control both your image of others and your well-being. According to the </span><span>laws of psychosomatics,</span><span> ill-fitting or uncomfortable clothing can even have a negative impact on you on a psychological level.</span></p>
<h2><span>Choosing clothing from an “energetic” perspective</span></h2>
<p><span>Fortunately, this mechanism also works in the other direction. So if you choose the “right” clothing, it strengthens you on all levels. You feel more comfortable, walk more upright, feel more self-confident, appear more likeable - this list of positive effects could go on.</span></p>
<p><span>You probably know the feeling from your own experience: If you're wearing your favorite clothes or dressed up for a special occasion, you feel much better and more confident. You appear differently, approach people more openly and feel like you have grown two meters. You feel a kind of inner radiance, inner power, inner passion - or whatever you want to call this energy.</span></p>
<p><span>However, this positive energetic effect should not remain an isolated case. Instead, you can and should make these every day as you get dressed and ready for the day ahead. If you want to choose the “right” clothing from an energetic perspective, the following factors play an important role:</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Fit</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>The fit of a piece of clothing has a big impact on how comfortable you feel in it. For example, there are short, medium-length or long dresses. You can wear a sweater with a neckline or a turtleneck. Tops for summer are available as T-shirts or tops with thin spaghetti straps. And when it comes to jeans, there are now </span><span>different fits for every type and style</span><span> , from skinny jeans to high waist, ankle or slim fit jeans to mom jeans or baggy pants .</span></p>
<p><span>To some extent, the question of fit is of course a matter of taste. While some feel more comfortable in tight-fitting clothing, others prefer the cozy “oversized look”. The main thing is that the clothing does not have any unpleasant pressure points. Sometimes the waistband of your pants digs into your stomach when you sit, or the bracelet is too tight and leaves red welts on your wrist.</span></p>
<p><span>No matter what type of clothing and accessories you ultimately choose: they have to fit so well that you feel completely comfortable - without the need to tug, pull, expand...</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Proportions</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>When it comes to the fit, it is also important that the proportions are correct. This does have more of an impact on the visual impact of the clothing, but it will certainly make you feel more comfortable. Choosing the right clothing gives you the opportunity to conceal alleged “problem areas” or to achieve a desired effect – for example, appearing taller or stronger.</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose loose clothing, it automatically makes you appear slimmer but less feminine. Men look a little more masculine if they have a slim figure. You can also visually reduce your height by wearing loose clothing.</span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, tight-fitting clothes make you appear taller. They emphasize your curves, for example the décolleté in women or the muscles on the upper arms in men. Depending on the fit, the jeans narrow or widen your hips or thighs, and shoulder pads make you appear more confident and stronger.</span></p>
<p><span>By consciously selecting your clothing items, you can freely model your proportions as you wish and thus adapt them perfectly to the respective occasion. Do you want to feel strong and confident at work, but want to appear feminine on a date or appear taller as a man? The possibilities are diverse and you can therefore positively influence your visual impact, as well as your own well-being, with the correct modeling of the proportions.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Color</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>From an energetic perspective, color plays a very important role when choosing clothing. You probably already know </span><span>how colors work</span><span> from </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . You can also apply many of the basic rules that apply there to clothing.</span></p>
<p><span>Clear and pure colors are recommended. A pure white, for example, or a bright yellow. Natural tones have a particularly relaxing effect on the body - even if they are below the surface, i.e. out of sight. Even your choice of underwear affects your energy.</span></p>
<p><span>It makes sense to put your entire outfit together every morning and adapt it perfectly to the day ahead. Whether you're going to </span><span>work</span><span> and have an important meeting or running around on the playground with your </span><span>kids</span><span> , your intentions make a big difference to your color choice.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also important to adapt the colors to the season and </span><span>your color type</span><span> . In winter, warm colors also make you feel warmer, while cold colors promise visual cooling in summer. Dark-haired people can wear light colors to compensate. Light-haired people can choose fresh but slightly darkened tones.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Pattern</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>For example, if you want more concentration at </span><span>work , you can choose the yellow sweater, but if you want to play with the </span><span>children</span><span> , choose the light blue sweater that exudes lightness. You are welcome to combine </span><span>colors</span><span> but also in patterns. However, avoid destructive patterns or symbols.</span></p>
<p><span>Similar to pictures in the </span><span>apartment</span><span> , the motifs should be positive. Knives, cracks, roses with thorns, heavy rivets or other burdensome decorations should be avoided because they weaken you on an energetic level. Therefore, choose positive and uplifting patterns and symbols - or, if in doubt, choose plain-colored items of clothing that radiate calm.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Materials</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>If you choose dyed clothing, it should ideally be dyed using natural products. Naturalness is the be-all and end-all when selecting materials. It doesn't necessarily have to be natural fibers, but rather it depends on the processing. Natural textiles can also be contaminated with harmful substances.</span></p>
<p><span>So choose natural and carefully processed materials such as cotton that feel comfortable on the skin. However, heavy items of clothing such as a leather jacket or platform shoes should be avoided. Also make sure that the material does not scratch or chafe.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Agility</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>The type of materials also determines their mobility. For example, skinny jeans must be made from special stretch fabric to ensure you have the freedom of movement you need.</span></p>
<p><span>Because movement is an important keyword: the “right” clothing supports you in your movements. Clothes should not restrict your mobility and therefore paralyze you on an energetic level.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you decide for or against a piece of clothing, it makes sense to test it to see if you can move freely in it. Sitting, standing, running, jumping – all activities must be possible without any problems, without you feeling any resistance or any other form of impairment. This is the only way the energy can flow freely.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>Protection</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>Finally, according to </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> clothing always means protection. The right shoes prevent cuts from broken glass or the hat protects you from the cold. For example, trousers with tears or tops and dresses with “cut-outs”, i.e. deliberately inserted holes, which are currently very trendy, are not recommended. Such clothing creates an uneven sensation of warmth and leaves some important energy centers unprotected.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, you can consciously protect such energy centers or strengthen them by choosing the right clothing. For example, a collar or scarf protects the throat chakra, high-waisted jeans protects your sacral chakra, or a low-slung hat protects the third eye. So if you feel a special need for protection due to challenges such as a difficult conversation, you can strengthen your well-being by wearing appropriate clothing and approach the situation more confidently.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-11" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2><span>Conclusion on body feng shui and clothing</span></h2>
<p><span>You see: </span><span>Classic Feng Shui</span><span> cannot be applied one-to-one to clothing. However, many of the basic rules can also be transferred to this. Be it the color effect or the symbolism - Body Feng Shui transfers the traditional approach to your physical well-being and helps you to increase it through the right choice of clothing.</span></p>
<p><span>From now on you will most likely pay more attention to your choice of outfit and its effect on your well-being. It also makes sense to continue to take a look at yourself at regular intervals and ask yourself questions such as: Has my style changed in the last few weeks or months? If yes, to what extent? What does this mean for my personal development? Where have I made progress? And where not (yet)?</span></p>
<p><span>If you take a closer look, the topic of clothing is by no means superficial, but rather says a lot about yourself - and can do a lot of good if you use body feng shui correctly!</span></p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap"><span>Ahectic everyday life demands a lot of physical and mental strength from you. This can have health consequences if you are not given the opportunity to refill your batteries. Even a cozy afternoon at home can help you shake off stress and find inner peace.</span></p>
<p><span>For many of us, our own home is a kind of protective space in which  </span><strong><span>mental barriers can be lowered</span></strong><span> . If you pay attention to a harmonious living space design, you will increase this stress-relieving effect.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How can Sheng Qi flow more easily?</span></h2>
<p><span>You can remedy the situation if there is an excess of Sha Qi by following the  </span><strong><span>basic Feng Shui rules</span></strong><span> when designing your living space  . </span></p>
<p><span>This classification can alternatively be applied to  </span><span>the outside of the house</span><span>  or the garden:</span></p>
<ul class="pfeile">
<li><span>In order to allow Sheng Qi to flow more easily, it is important to ensure a clear and orderly arrangement of furniture and objects in your living space in order to avoid obstacles.</span></li>
<li><span>Placing mirrors in strategic locations throughout your home can promote Sheng Qi by reflecting light and directing energy into different rooms.</span></li>
<li><span>Introducing live plants and fresh flowers into your rooms can invigorate Sheng Qi and enhance positive energies.</span></li>
<li><span>Provide adequate lighting in your home to illuminate energy flows and activate Sheng Qi in different areas.</span></li>
<li><span>Use  </span><span>colors</span><span>  and decorations in your spaces that speak to your personal energy and evoke positive feelings to support and allow Sheng Qi to flow naturally.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Feng Shui as a mindfulness exercise for targeted stress reduction</span></h2>
<p><strong><span>By actively shaping your living space, your situational and general self-efficacy</span></strong><span> increases   - the feeling of being able to consciously and successfully take challenges into your own hands. This feeling has a positive effect on your self-perception, self-confidence and ultimately your mental health.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How do colors and materials in Feng Shui influence your well-being?</span></h2>
<p><span>In addition to conscious engagement with your surroundings and the associated self-efficacy,  </span><strong><span>living space design according to Feng Shui itself</span></strong><span> influences  the atmosphere in your home:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Earth:</span></strong><span>  In addition to the color yellow, typical earth tones such as light and dark brown are recommended for environmental design. The nuances from nature symbolize reliability and steadfastness. At the same time, they can  </span><strong><span>convey a feeling of security</span></strong><span> . The materials that, according to the theory of harmony, allow positive energy to flow include ceramics, clay, terracotta and stone.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Wood:</span></strong><span>  Areas of life that can be attributed to wood should be designed in shades of green. Natural materials such as wood, bamboo or paper predominate here. You can also work your room with painted, printed or photographed natural scenes, the viewing of which  </span><strong><span>promotes inner peace and triggers positive emotions</span></strong><span> . Looking at plants or water also helps to cope with stress.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Water</span></strong><span> : The color of the sea matches the water: blue. Light or dark shades of blue are used by many people as  </span><strong><span>a symbol of peace, relaxation and gentleness.</span></strong><span>  In addition to water surfaces, glass and mirrors symbolize the gentle and wild element.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Fire:</span></strong><span>  In rooms marked by fire, leather and plastics can predominate as materials. Colors that match this powerful element are purple, orange and reds. Although the latter put the subconscious on alert, they also represent strong emotions.</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Metal:</span></strong><span>  The fifth element in  </span><span>Feng Shui </span><span> is metal, to which the material of the same name is assigned. Neutral colors such as white and gray have a calming effect on the eye and mood.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This interplay of materials and  </span><span>colors</span><span>  in the rooms creates a feel-good atmosphere in your home thanks to the resulting harmonious look. This can help you block out the stress of everyday life and   relax, </span><strong><span>freed from conscious and subconscious stress .</span></strong></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How does Feng Shui affect your own well-being?</span></h2>
<p><span>The term “ </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> ”, like  </span><strong><span>the theory of harmony</span></strong><span>  itself, which is thousands of years old, comes from Chinese. It translates as “wind” and “water”. Feng Shui aims to  </span><strong><span>harmonize people with their surroundings</span></strong><span>  . Through the harmonious arrangement of the elements and the associated design of your living space, you direct your Qi in positive directions. This in turn should help you cope with physical and mental stress as well as inner restlessness.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Stress consciously experienced as a burden on the body and mind</span></h2>
<p><span>Temporary stressful situations burden those affected on two levels: physically and psychologically. The </span><span>study “Relax, Germany!”</span><span> published in 2021   by the Techniker Krankenkasse provides an overview of  </span><strong><span>the frequency of health consequences caused by stress</span></strong><span> . Respondents who often felt stressed said they suffered from:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Exhaustion (80 percent)</span></li>
<li><span>Nervousness (62 percent)</span></li>
<li><span>Sleep problems (52 percent)</span></li>
<li><span>Headaches and migraines (40 percent)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>34 percent of the study participants said they felt low or even depressed due to frequent stressful situations.</span></p>
<p><span>Acute stress puts the body on alert. However, the symptoms that occur usually subside once you overcome the challenging situation. </span></p>
<p><span>The situation is different with inner restlessness, which can become a  </span><strong><span>permanent side effect in everyday life</span></strong><span>  . Persistent stress in private and professional areas is one of the  </span><span>causes of inner restlessness</span><span> , constant tension and nervousness.</span></p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Unknown danger: subconscious stress caused by a disharmonious environment</span></h2>
<p><span>One of the subconscious factors that influence your mental well-being is the design of your living space. A chaotic or untidy environment will make you feel restless and tense at home. Instead of relaxation, another stress factor awaits you in your own four walls  </span><span>, which, according to a study, deprives you of your feeling of security</span><span> .</span></p>
<p><span>You can avoid subconscious stress in your own home by redesigning your environment. If you pay attention to the teachings of wind and water, you can  </span><strong><span>optimize your energy flow and thus find peace more easily</span></strong><span> . The  </span><span>individual furnishing of your living space</span><span>  has a positive influence on your quality of life for several reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The perceived self-efficacy when designing your living space increases your self-confidence</span></li>
<li><span>The individual design of your environment helps you to develop your personality</span></li>
<li><span>Active tidying up and rearranging can distract you from the constantly circling carousel of thoughts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At the same time, you can get to know new sides of yourself and engage with them through the conscious choice of color and style for your furnishings.</span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The influence of Sheng Qi and Sha Qi on your well-being</span></h2>
<p><span>In Chinese harmony, a distinction is made between Sheng Qi and Sha Qi. While the latter is mentally draining and disrupts your inner balance,  </span><strong><span>Sheng Qi is life-giving</span></strong><span> . The so-called “dragon breath” is said to have a positive effect on all your senses and thereby stabilize your physical and mental health.</span></p>
<p><span>Rough edges and untidy structures are considered Sha Qi. This is more prevalent in some apartments than in others. For example  , according to Feng Shui theory, anyone who </span><span>suffers from Messi Syndrome</span><span> is also burdened by a preponderance of Sha Qi within their own four walls.  This disturbing energy can also manifest itself in your  </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> ,  </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span>  or even in the  </span><span>Feng Shui children's room through unfavorable, disharmonious furnishings.</span></p>

<p><span>Feng Shui, an ancient Chinese practice that literally means “wind and water,” is much more than just a method of interior design. It is a complex science that aims to promote harmony between man and his environment. The roots of Feng Shui go back thousands of years and are closely linked to Chinese culture, philosophy and cosmology.</span></p>
<p><span>Originally developed to determine the optimal placement of buildings and structures in harmony with nature, Feng Shui is based on the idea that everything in the world is permeated by the invisible life energy, “Qi.” This energy flows through space and influences people's well-being and quality of life.</span></p>
<p><span>Feng Shui also focuses on concepts such as </span><span>Yin and Yang</span><span> , the polarities of darkness and light, softness and hardness, which must be kept in balance to achieve harmony. In addition, the directions and orientations of buildings play an important role as they can influence the flow of energy and the quality of Qi.</span></p>

<p><span> A harmonious environment creates a welcoming atmosphere that invites guests to relax, feel good and unwind. It helps reduce stress and promote overall well-being, ultimately leading to a positive guest experience.</span></p>

<p><span>A hotel's interior design</span><span> plays a crucial role in creating a welcoming and harmonious environment for guests. By applying Feng Shui principles, the flow and energy within the hotel can be optimized, resulting in a comfortable and relaxing stay for guests.</span></p>
<p><span>To improve the flow of space, it is important that the different areas of the hotel are seamlessly connected. </span></p>
<p><span>Guests should be able to move freely and unhindered without being hindered by unnecessary obstacles or bottlenecks. This can be achieved through well-thought-out room design and the placement of furniture that supports the flow of Qi.</span></p>
<p><span>An example of this is the placement of reception areas and lobby furniture. These should be arranged in such a way that they give guests a feeling of openness and space. </span></p>
<p><span>Large, open spaces with flowing lines and gentle curves promote the flow of energy and create a welcoming atmosphere. By using natural materials such as wood and stone, the connection to nature can be strengthened, which further increases the well-being of the guests.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, other rooms in the hotel, such as restaurants, meeting rooms and wellness areas, should also be designed according to Feng Shui principles. Careful placement of furniture and </span><span>decorative elements</span><span> , as well as conscious selection of </span><span>colors</span><span> and materials, can help promote positive energy and create a harmonious balance throughout the hotel.</span></p>

<p><span>It is important to choose furniture and decorative elements carefully to ensure that they are not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing and in accordance with Feng Shui principles.

<p><span>Particular attention should also be paid to the bathroom, a place of personal relaxation and renewal. Proper placement of </span><span>towels in the bathroom</span><span> can help improve guests' energy and well-being.</span></p>
<p><span> According to Feng Shui principles, towels should be folded neatly and stored in a well-ventilated place to promote positive energy. Using soft, high-quality towels in soothing colors can also help create a relaxing atmosphere and increase guests' well-being.</span></p>
<p><span>By carefully selecting and placing furniture and decorative elements, hotels can create an environment that invites guests to relax, unwind and recharge.</span></p>

                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harmonious wall design according to Feng Shui: Your path to positive energy</h2>
<p>The art of Feng Shui, a Chinese philosophy that is thousands of years old, is used to create harmonious and energetically balanced living spaces. In this context, wall design plays a central role because walls not only surround us; they define the space and have a significant influence on our well-being.</p>
<p>Below you will discover how you can use targeted measures in your wall design to create a home that is not only visually appealing, but also energetically in harmony with your needs.</p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The basics of your Feng Shui wall design</h2>
<p>Feng Shui, a profound philosophy originating in Chinese culture, aims to bring harmony and balance to people's living spaces. An essential element of this practice is the careful design of the walls , which not only define the physical space but also act as carriers of energetic potentials.</p>
<p>Wall design according to Feng Shui follows the principle of balance of the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements, represented by colors and materials, interact with each other and therefore directly influence the well-being and energy in a room.</p>
<p>Harmonizing these elements requires a deep understanding of the meaning of colors and their effect on people. For example , shades of green that represent the wood element promote growth and renewal, while shades of blue that represent the water element bring calm and relaxation to a room. Each color and material contributes in a unique way to shaping the atmosphere of a room and supporting its energetic flow.</p>
<p>A significant innovation in the area of ​​Feng Shui wall design is bio-active wall paints, which have become more important in recent years. These colors, developed based on the latest research, go far beyond aesthetic function.</p>
<p>They actively improve air quality by breaking down pollutants and thus contribute to a healthier living environment. This innovative concept combines traditional wisdom with modern technology and opens up new ways to implement the principles of Feng Shui in contemporary living spaces.</p>
<p>Consciously choosing colors and materials according to the teachings of Feng Shui allows you to create spaces that are both visually appealing and a source of positive energy and harmony. Bio-active wall paints represent the bridge between ancient wisdom and modern science, a fusion that has the potential to profoundly transform your living space.</p>
<p>By integrating these elements into your home during a Feng Shui consultation, you create a place of balance and well-being that honors and advances the foundations of Feng Shui in an innovative way.</p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose wall coverings carefully</h2>
<p>A particular challenge in wall design is choosing the right material. This brings into focus the question of whether wallpapering woodchip on woodchip is a wise decision. There is no general answer to this, but the site offers valuable insights and practical advice that can help you make a decision.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-1024x683.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Six points to consider include:</h2>
<p>1. The quality of your existing wallpaper layer is crucial for the result of the wall design. A high-quality, well-preserved layer of wallpaper forms the optimal basis for further beautification measures. However, if the existing wallpaper is damaged or of poor quality, this could affect the overall look and require additional work to create a harmonious basis for the new design.</p>
<p>2. The texture of your new woodchip wallpaper plays an important role in the atmosphere and energy structure in the room. Woodchip wallpapers, known for their robustness and textural diversity, allow a wide range of design options. When choosing, you should make sure that the structure and weight of the wallpaper harmonize with the spatial conditions and the intended style.</p>
<p>3. The desired effect in the room significantly influences the selection of materials and colors . Feng Shui aims to create an environment that meets your personal needs and desired mood. Whether you want a calming oasis of relaxation or an invigorating and inspiring workspace , every decision should serve these goals.</p>
<p>4. Compatibility with the principles of Feng Shui is essential to ensure a positive energy flow and harmony. The choice of wallpaper and its properties should support the balance of the five elements, creating a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also contributes to well-being.</p>
<p>5. The longevity and ease of care of your wallpaper are practical aspects that should not be underestimated. High-quality wallpapers not only promise an attractive look for years to come, but are also easier to clean and replace if necessary. This ensures that your home remains a source of joy and comfort well into the future.</p>
<p>6. The ecological impact of your choice of wallpaper is becoming increasingly important. In line with the principles of Feng Shui and the growing need for sustainable action, you should choose wallpapers that are produced in an environmentally friendly manner and contain healthy, low-pollutant materials. This consideration not only helps protect our planet; it also promotes a healthy living environment and increases the positive energy in the room.</p>
<p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor "></span></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wall displays as a smart solution</h2>
<p>An innovative development in wall design in recent years is digital wall displays, which make it possible to dynamically change the aesthetics of a room. These state-of-the-art displays can display landscapes, artwork or calming patterns that can be changed as desired. They allow the atmosphere of a room to be adapted to the mood or occasion, promoting positive energy and creating a unique connection between digital technology and the principles of Feng Shui for a harmonious home.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: A home in harmony with Feng Shui</h2>
<p>Wall design according to the principles of Feng Shui transforms rooms into sources of positive energy and well-being. By consciously selecting colors, materials and the latest technologies in wall coverings, you can create an environment that is not only visually appealing, but also works on a deeper, energetic level. The integration of elements such as bio-active colors or wall displays marks the beginning of a new era in harmonious interior design that promotes health and happiness.</p>
