This can have health consequences if you are not given the opportunity to refill your batteries. Even a cozy afternoon at home can help you shake off stress and find inner peace.</span></p><p><span>For many of us, our own home is a kind of protective space in which  </span><strong><span>mental barriers can be lowered</span></strong><span> . If you pay attention to a harmonious living space design, you will increase this stress-relieving effect.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How can Sheng Qi flow more easily?</span></h2><p><span>You can remedy the situation if there is an excess of Sha Qi by following the  </span><strong><span>basic Feng Shui rules</span></strong><span> when designing your living space  . </span></p><p><span>This classification can alternatively be applied to  </span><span>the outside of the house</span><span>  or the garden:</span></p><ul class="pfeile"><li><span>In order to allow Sheng Qi to flow more easily, it is important to ensure a clear and orderly arrangement of furniture and objects in your living space in order to avoid obstacles.</span></li><li><span>Placing mirrors in strategic locations throughout your home can promote Sheng Qi by reflecting light and directing energy into different rooms.</span></li><li><span>Introducing live plants and fresh flowers into your rooms can invigorate Sheng Qi and enhance positive energies.</span></li><li><span>Provide adequate lighting in your home to illuminate energy flows and activate Sheng Qi in different areas.</span></li><li><span>Use  </span><span>colors</span><span>  and decorations in your spaces that speak to your personal energy and evoke positive feelings to support and allow Sheng Qi to flow naturally.</span></li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Feng Shui as a mindfulness exercise for targeted stress reduction</span></h2><p><strong><span>By actively shaping your living space, your situational and general self-efficacy</span></strong><span> increases   - the feeling of being able to consciously and successfully take challenges into your own hands. This feeling has a positive effect on your self-perception, self-confidence and ultimately your mental health.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How do colors and materials in Feng Shui influence your well-being?</span></h2><p><span>In addition to conscious engagement with your surroundings and the associated self-efficacy,  </span><strong><span>living space design according to Feng Shui itself</span></strong><span> influences  the atmosphere in your home:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Earth:</span></strong><span>  In addition to the color yellow, typical earth tones such as light and dark brown are recommended for environmental design. The nuances from nature symbolize reliability and steadfastness. At the same time, they can  </span><strong><span>convey a feeling of security</span></strong><span> . The materials that, according to the theory of harmony, allow positive energy to flow include ceramics, clay, terracotta and stone.</span></li><li><strong><span>Wood:</span></strong><span>  Areas of life that can be attributed to wood should be designed in shades of green. Natural materials such as wood, bamboo or paper predominate here. You can also work your room with painted, printed or photographed natural scenes, the viewing of which  </span><strong><span>promotes inner peace and triggers positive emotions</span></strong><span> . Looking at plants or water also helps to cope with stress.</span></li><li><strong><span>Water</span></strong><span> : The color of the sea matches the water: blue. Light or dark shades of blue are used by many people as  </span><strong><span>a symbol of peace, relaxation and gentleness.</span></strong><span>  In addition to water surfaces, glass and mirrors symbolize the gentle and wild element.</span></li><li><strong><span>Fire:</span></strong><span>  In rooms marked by fire, leather and plastics can predominate as materials. Colors that match this powerful element are purple, orange and reds. Although the latter put the subconscious on alert, they also represent strong emotions.</span></li><li><strong><span>Metal:</span></strong><span>  The fifth element in  </span><span>Feng Shui </span><span> is metal, to which the material of the same name is assigned. Neutral colors such as white and gray have a calming effect on the eye and mood.</span></li></ul><p><span>This interplay of materials and  </span><span>colors</span><span>  in the rooms creates a feel-good atmosphere in your home thanks to the resulting harmonious look. This can help you block out the stress of everyday life and   relax, </span><strong><span>freed from conscious and subconscious stress .</span></strong></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>How does Feng Shui affect your own well-being?</span></h2><p><span>The term “ </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> ”, like  </span><strong><span>the theory of harmony</span></strong><span>  itself, which is thousands of years old, comes from Chinese. It translates as “wind” and “water”. Feng Shui aims to  </span><strong><span>harmonize people with their surroundings</span></strong><span>  . Through the harmonious arrangement of the elements and the associated design of your living space, you direct your Qi in positive directions. This in turn should help you cope with physical and mental stress as well as inner restlessness.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Stress consciously experienced as a burden on the body and mind</span></h2><p><span>Temporary stressful situations burden those affected on two levels: physically and psychologically. The </span><span>study “Relax, Germany!”</span><span> published in 2021   by the Techniker Krankenkasse provides an overview of  </span><strong><span>the frequency of health consequences caused by stress</span></strong><span> . Respondents who often felt stressed said they suffered from:</span></p><ul><li><span>Exhaustion (80 percent)</span></li><li><span>Nervousness (62 percent)</span></li><li><span>Sleep problems (52 percent)</span></li><li><span>Headaches and migraines (40 percent)</span></li></ul><p><span>34 percent of the study participants said they felt low or even depressed due to frequent stressful situations.</span></p><p><span>Acute stress puts the body on alert. However, the symptoms that occur usually subside once you overcome the challenging situation. </span></p><p><span>The situation is different with inner restlessness, which can become a  </span><strong><span>permanent side effect in everyday life</span></strong><span>  . Persistent stress in private and professional areas is one of the  </span><span>causes of inner restlessness</span><span> , constant tension and nervousness.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Unknown danger: subconscious stress caused by a disharmonious environment</span></h2><p><span>One of the subconscious factors that influence your mental well-being is the design of your living space. A chaotic or untidy environment will make you feel restless and tense at home. Instead of relaxation, another stress factor awaits you in your own four walls  </span><span>, which, according to a study, deprives you of your feeling of security</span><span> .</span></p><p><span>You can avoid subconscious stress in your own home by redesigning your environment. If you pay attention to the teachings of wind and water, you can  </span><strong><span>optimize your energy flow and thus find peace more easily</span></strong><span> . The  </span><span>individual furnishing of your living space</span><span>  has a positive influence on your quality of life for several reasons:</span></p><ul><li><span>The perceived self-efficacy when designing your living space increases your self-confidence</span></li><li><span>The individual design of your environment helps you to develop your personality</span></li><li><span>Active tidying up and rearranging can distract you from the constantly circling carousel of thoughts</span></li></ul><p><span>At the same time, you can get to know new sides of yourself and engage with them through the conscious choice of color and style for your furnishings.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The influence of Sheng Qi and Sha Qi on your well-being</span></h2><p><span>In Chinese harmony, a distinction is made between Sheng Qi and Sha Qi. While the latter is mentally draining and disrupts your inner balance,  </span><strong><span>Sheng Qi is life-giving</span></strong><span> . The so-called “dragon breath” is said to have a positive effect on all your senses and thereby stabilize your physical and mental health.</span></p><p><span>Rough edges and untidy structures are considered Sha Qi. This is more prevalent in some apartments than in others. For example  , according to Feng Shui theory, anyone who </span><span>suffers from Messi Syndrome</span><span> is also burdened by a preponderance of Sha Qi within their own four walls.  This disturbing energy can also manifest itself in your  </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> ,  </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span>  or even in the  </span><span>Feng Shui children's room through unfavorable, disharmonious furnishings.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 3, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-hotel-tips-for-hotel-owners-and-managers/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/4/responsive/shutterstock_622608710-1024x684-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui Hotel – Tips for hotel owners and managers" height="684" width="1024"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Feng Shui Hotel – Tips for hotel owners and managers</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/the-effect-of-clothing/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>The effect of clothing</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/1/responsive/kleider-machen-leute-die-wirkung-von-kleidung-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="kleider machen leute die wirkung von kleidung" height="480" width="720"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/renovation-work-according-to-feng-shui-how-can-you-finance-it/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/8/responsive/shell-367402_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="420" width="640" alt="Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/renovation-work-according-to-feng-shui-how-can-you-finance-it/" class="inverse">Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-27T13:00" class="u-small">April 27, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/find-your-real-dream-apartment-according-to-feng-shui-these-things-should-be-taken-into-account-when-looking-for-an-apartment/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/7/responsive/Echte-Traumwohnung-finden_-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="According to Feng Shui, these things should be taken into account when looking for an apartment"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/find-your-real-dream-apartment-according-to-feng-shui-these-things-should-be-taken-into-account-when-looking-for-an-apartment/" class="inverse">Find your real dream apartment: According to Feng Shui, these things should be taken into account when looking for an apartment</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-28T13:00" class="u-small">April 28, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/6/responsive/ai-generated-8111336_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="437" width="640" alt="Feng Shui in the wardrobe"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="inverse">Feng Shui in the wardrobe</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-29T13:00" class="u-small">April 29, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="3" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/stress-management-this-is-how-feng-shui-affects-your-well-being/" data-page-title="Stress management: This is how Feng Shui affects your well-being" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
