saying. In fact, the way we dress has a lot to do with our own self-image and the image we want to convey to others. Clothing always works on two levels: internally and externally.</span></p><p><span>But in addition to the visual effect, what we wear is also said to have an energetic effect. It is therefore quite interesting to take a closer look at the topic of clothing and think about whether and to what extent your choice of clothing actually reflects you - or how you can improve it according to </span><span>Feng Shui .</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2><span>View clothing as a reflection of your personality</span></h2><p><span>Many people carelessly follow one trend after another. They follow what styles are currently popular with friends, in magazines or on the Internet and imitate the outfits of their fashion role models.</span></p><p><span>Others don't worry about their clothes at all. They simply wear the discarded clothes of siblings or friends. The main thing is cheap and comfortable, is their motto. However, the appearance plays a subordinate role for them.</span></p><h3><span>There is no “right” or “wrong” when dealing with clothing.</span></h3><p><span>After all, everyone is allowed to wear what he or she likes - and that's a good thing. In many other countries around the world this is not (yet) a given.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, it can be interesting to question your personal approach to clothing. This reveals a lot about you and what is important to you in life. If you're always following trends, you may not have found your own look yet - in a figurative sense, you haven't yet found yourself.</span></p><p><span>In contrast, people who have little to no concern for their appearance may tend not to take themselves seriously enough. They are not worth buying new shoes or an expensive trip to the hairdresser.</span></p><p><span>Instead, they may have developed a habit of always putting other people, such as their </span><span>children,</span><span> before themselves - even if </span><span>their altruism</span><span> comes at the expense of their own well-being or even health.</span></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/farben-beeinflussen-uns-bei-der-kleidung.jpg" alt="A lady with a cap and sweater in red" data-is-external-image="true"></p><h2><span>Clothing is part of your personality development</span></h2><p><span>These are just a few examples of many, but they already make it clear to what extent clothing can be a reflection of your personality. Every person has different reasons why they approach the topic of outfits or styling in a certain way. It can therefore be interesting to examine your own motives.</span></p><p><span>As superficial as the topic may seem at first glance, it is profound at second glance. Because you will quickly notice how your clothing style changes as your personality matures. Suddenly you might feel confident wearing bolder </span><span>colors</span><span> because you've gained more self-confidence. Or the extra self-love finally allows you to treat yourself to new clothes every now and then and reward yourself for a stressful everyday life.</span></p><p><span>Clothes may not make you a different person, but you can also have an effect on the inside: a new hairdresser might give you more self-acceptance or the new jeans in the perfect fit will make a few pounds appear visually and give you self-confidence and the courage to do so upcoming presentation.</span></p><div><p><span>Here too the list of examples is long. The fact is: internal and external changes go hand in hand. You can't just change something on one level without feeling an effect on the other levels - be it internally, optically, spiritually, externally or energetically.</span></p></div><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2><span>Sustainability</span></h2><p><span>In addition to clothing, bags can also be wonderfully printed and given away as merchandise or sold. More and more people are paying attention to their own sustainability, and jute bags are just as important to use here. </span></p><p><span>They are also used every day and are therefore free advertising space. You can easily </span><span>have jute bags printed</span><span> online and then distribute them to employees and customers. You can also fill them with other goodies for an even better promotional effect. At the same time, reusable bags always do something for the environment, so it's a win-win for everyone.</span></p><div><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span><h2><span>The connection between clothing and Feng Shui</span></h2><p><span>Long story short: There is a direct connection between your choice of clothing and your personality. You will probably always find yourself sorting people into “pigeons” based on their external appearance.</span></p><p><span>The man with the long hair and the band shirt probably likes going to heavy metal concerts and the woman in the perfectly fitting business suit is career-oriented.</span></p><p><span>Such conclusions from the outside to the inside are completely natural - but that doesn't mean that they are always true. But this hasty judgment is a natural mechanism in the brain and you will then subconsciously do everything you can to confirm </span><span>your first impression again and again.</span></p><p><span>Your choice of clothing largely determines how you appear to other people - but also to yourself. And this is exactly where </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> can come into play. This special form is often referred to as Body Feng Shui.</span></p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span><h2><span>What is behind the term “Body Feng Shui”?</span></h2><p><span>When it comes to Feng Shui,  </span><span>the focus is on the living spaces</span><span> . However, the teaching can also be applied to many other areas of life - for example health. Body Feng Shui is a continuation of </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> and primarily looks at the impact of clothing on your self-image, well-being, your personality and your life in general.</span></p><p><span>In Body Feng Shui, clothing is also viewed as a kind of </span><span>space</span><span> that surrounds you like a second skin. Strictly speaking, the clothes are much closer to you than the actual room, which could be viewed as a third skin, so to speak.</span></p><p><span>Body Feng Shui is all about well-being in your own body, which includes not only clothing but also your own weight and physical performance. Clothes are not the only important factor in body feng shui, but also your health in general or internal thought patterns and beliefs. But in addition to working on the inside, you can also work on your “second skin” here – your external appearance.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2><span>What are the goals of clothing according to Feng Shui?</span></h2><p><span>According to Feng Shui</span><span> , working on your appearance does n't mean going to a plastic surgeon or spending a lot of money on cosmetics or going to the hairdresser. Instead, it's about creating a “feel-good space” for yourself through the right styling, which has a positive effect on your well-being, for example through more self-confidence or simply coziness.</span></p><p><span>Because the feeling of a warm and fluffy sweater in winter, the cozy sneakers that carry you lightly through life, or the hat that gives you a feeling of security - they all increase your well-being.</span></p><p><span>Clothing can therefore be a comfort zone. It protects you from danger, keeps you warm on cold days and determines how your body feels. It therefore creates a strong energetic effect.</span></p><h2><span>A look at the energetic effect of clothes</span></h2><p><span>If clothing is viewed based on the </span><span>teachings of Feng Shui</span><span> , the same rules apply to it as to </span><span>rooms</span><span> . Because as you already know, your clothes represent, so to speak, the smallest room in which you find yourself. It is therefore important to choose </span><span>the colors</span><span> , fabrics and cuts carefully. Similar rooms are the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> , the Feng Shui living room, the </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span></p><p><span>On the one hand, the visual appearance determines the energetic effect your clothing has on you and those around you. On the other hand, as already mentioned, clothing also largely influences your well-being and therefore </span><span>your body language</span><span> and your energetic charisma.</span></p><h4><span>To clarify, use the following example:</span></h4><p><span>For example, if you wear clothing that is too tight, uncomfortable shoes, or heavy jewelry around your neck, you may feel uncomfortable in your skin. You adopt a crouched and stiff posture, walk unsteadily or breathe heavily. This not only affects your well-being, but also your impact on other people.</span></p><p><span>With the right or wrong clothing, you can actively control both your image of others and your well-being. According to the </span><span>laws of psychosomatics,</span><span> ill-fitting or uncomfortable clothing can even have a negative impact on you on a psychological level.</span></p><h2><span>Choosing clothing from an “energetic” perspective</span></h2><p><span>Fortunately, this mechanism also works in the other direction. So if you choose the “right” clothing, it strengthens you on all levels. You feel more comfortable, walk more upright, feel more self-confident, appear more likeable - this list of positive effects could go on.</span></p><p><span>You probably know the feeling from your own experience: If you're wearing your favorite clothes or dressed up for a special occasion, you feel much better and more confident. You appear differently, approach people more openly and feel like you have grown two meters. You feel a kind of inner radiance, inner power, inner passion - or whatever you want to call this energy.</span></p><p><span>However, this positive energetic effect should not remain an isolated case. Instead, you can and should make these every day as you get dressed and ready for the day ahead. If you want to choose the “right” clothing from an energetic perspective, the following factors play an important role:</span></p><h3><strong><span>Fit</span></strong></h3><p><span>The fit of a piece of clothing has a big impact on how comfortable you feel in it. For example, there are short, medium-length or long dresses. You can wear a sweater with a neckline or a turtleneck. Tops for summer are available as T-shirts or tops with thin spaghetti straps. And when it comes to jeans, there are now </span><span>different fits for every type and style</span><span> , from skinny jeans to high waist, ankle or slim fit jeans to mom jeans or baggy pants .</span></p><p><span>To some extent, the question of fit is of course a matter of taste. While some feel more comfortable in tight-fitting clothing, others prefer the cozy “oversized look”. The main thing is that the clothing does not have any unpleasant pressure points. Sometimes the waistband of your pants digs into your stomach when you sit, or the bracelet is too tight and leaves red welts on your wrist.</span></p><p><span>No matter what type of clothing and accessories you ultimately choose: they have to fit so well that you feel completely comfortable - without the need to tug, pull, expand...</span></p><h3><strong><span>Proportions</span></strong></h3><p><span>When it comes to the fit, it is also important that the proportions are correct. This does have more of an impact on the visual impact of the clothing, but it will certainly make you feel more comfortable. Choosing the right clothing gives you the opportunity to conceal alleged “problem areas” or to achieve a desired effect – for example, appearing taller or stronger.</span></p><p><span>If you choose loose clothing, it automatically makes you appear slimmer but less feminine. Men look a little more masculine if they have a slim figure. You can also visually reduce your height by wearing loose clothing.</span></p><p><span>In contrast, tight-fitting clothes make you appear taller. They emphasize your curves, for example the décolleté in women or the muscles on the upper arms in men. Depending on the fit, the jeans narrow or widen your hips or thighs, and shoulder pads make you appear more confident and stronger.</span></p><p><span>By consciously selecting your clothing items, you can freely model your proportions as you wish and thus adapt them perfectly to the respective occasion. Do you want to feel strong and confident at work, but want to appear feminine on a date or appear taller as a man? The possibilities are diverse and you can therefore positively influence your visual impact, as well as your own well-being, with the correct modeling of the proportions.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Color</span></strong></h3><p><span>From an energetic perspective, color plays a very important role when choosing clothing. You probably already know </span><span>how colors work</span><span> from </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . You can also apply many of the basic rules that apply there to clothing.</span></p><p><span>Clear and pure colors are recommended. A pure white, for example, or a bright yellow. Natural tones have a particularly relaxing effect on the body - even if they are below the surface, i.e. out of sight. Even your choice of underwear affects your energy.</span></p><p><span>It makes sense to put your entire outfit together every morning and adapt it perfectly to the day ahead. Whether you're going to </span><span>work</span><span> and have an important meeting or running around on the playground with your </span><span>kids</span><span> , your intentions make a big difference to your color choice.</span></p><p><span>It is also important to adapt the colors to the season and </span><span>your color type</span><span> . In winter, warm colors also make you feel warmer, while cold colors promise visual cooling in summer. Dark-haired people can wear light colors to compensate. Light-haired people can choose fresh but slightly darkened tones.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Pattern</span></strong></h3><p><span>For example, if you want more concentration at </span><span>work , you can choose the yellow sweater, but if you want to play with the </span><span>children</span><span> , choose the light blue sweater that exudes lightness. You are welcome to combine </span><span>colors</span><span> but also in patterns. However, avoid destructive patterns or symbols.</span></p><p><span>Similar to pictures in the </span><span>apartment</span><span> , the motifs should be positive. Knives, cracks, roses with thorns, heavy rivets or other burdensome decorations should be avoided because they weaken you on an energetic level. Therefore, choose positive and uplifting patterns and symbols - or, if in doubt, choose plain-colored items of clothing that radiate calm.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Materials</span></strong></h3><p><span>If you choose dyed clothing, it should ideally be dyed using natural products. Naturalness is the be-all and end-all when selecting materials. It doesn't necessarily have to be natural fibers, but rather it depends on the processing. Natural textiles can also be contaminated with harmful substances.</span></p><p><span>So choose natural and carefully processed materials such as cotton that feel comfortable on the skin. However, heavy items of clothing such as a leather jacket or platform shoes should be avoided. Also make sure that the material does not scratch or chafe.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Agility</span></strong></h3><p><span>The type of materials also determines their mobility. For example, skinny jeans must be made from special stretch fabric to ensure you have the freedom of movement you need.</span></p><p><span>Because movement is an important keyword: the “right” clothing supports you in your movements. Clothes should not restrict your mobility and therefore paralyze you on an energetic level.</span></p><p><span>Before you decide for or against a piece of clothing, it makes sense to test it to see if you can move freely in it. Sitting, standing, running, jumping – all activities must be possible without any problems, without you feeling any resistance or any other form of impairment. This is the only way the energy can flow freely.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Protection</span></strong></h3><p><span>Finally, according to </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> clothing always means protection. The right shoes prevent cuts from broken glass or the hat protects you from the cold. For example, trousers with tears or tops and dresses with “cut-outs”, i.e. deliberately inserted holes, which are currently very trendy, are not recommended. Such clothing creates an uneven sensation of warmth and leaves some important energy centers unprotected.</span></p><p><span>Instead, you can consciously protect such energy centers or strengthen them by choosing the right clothing. For example, a collar or scarf protects the throat chakra, high-waisted jeans protects your sacral chakra, or a low-slung hat protects the third eye. So if you feel a special need for protection due to challenges such as a difficult conversation, you can strengthen your well-being by wearing appropriate clothing and approach the situation more confidently.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-11" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2><span>Conclusion on body feng shui and clothing</span></h2><p><span>You see: </span><span>Classic Feng Shui</span><span> cannot be applied one-to-one to clothing. However, many of the basic rules can also be transferred to this. Be it the color effect or the symbolism - Body Feng Shui transfers the traditional approach to your physical well-being and helps you to increase it through the right choice of clothing.</span></p><p><span>From now on you will most likely pay more attention to your choice of outfit and its effect on your well-being. It also makes sense to continue to take a look at yourself at regular intervals and ask yourself questions such as: Has my style changed in the last few weeks or months? If yes, to what extent? What does this mean for my personal development? Where have I made progress? And where not (yet)?</span></p><p><span>If you take a closer look, the topic of clothing is by no means superficial, but rather says a lot about yourself - and can do a lot of good if you use body feng shui correctly!</span></p></div></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 3, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/stress-management-this-is-how-feng-shui-affects-your-well-being/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/3/responsive/Feng-Shui-Beratung-shutterstock_2065274396-1024x694-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui as a mindfulness exercise for targeted stress reduction" height="694" width="1024"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Stress management: This is how Feng Shui affects your well-being</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-furniture-with-the-right-dimensions/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Feng Shui furniture with the right dimensions</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/2/responsive/da-guojing-6888603_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui furniture with the right dimensions" height="427" width="640"></a></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="1" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/the-effect-of-clothing/" data-page-title="The effect of clothing" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
