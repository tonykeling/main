Clothing always works on two levels: internally and externally.</span></p>\n<p><span>But in addition to the visual effect, what we wear is also said to have an energetic effect. It is therefore quite interesting to take a closer look at the topic of clothing and think about whether and to what extent your choice of clothing actually reflects you - or how you can improve it according to </span><span>Feng Shui .</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>View clothing as a reflection of your personality</span></h2>\n<p><span>Many people carelessly follow one trend after another. They follow what styles are currently popular with friends, in magazines or on the Internet and imitate the outfits of their fashion role models.</span></p>\n<p><span>Others don't worry about their clothes at all. They simply wear the discarded clothes of siblings or friends. The main thing is cheap and comfortable, is their motto. However, the appearance plays a subordinate role for them.</span></p>\n<h3><span>There is no “right” or “wrong” when dealing with clothing.</span></h3>\n<p><span>After all, everyone is allowed to wear what he or she likes - and that's a good thing. In many other countries around the world this is not (yet) a given.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, it can be interesting to question your personal approach to clothing. This reveals a lot about you and what is important to you in life. If you're always following trends, you may not have found your own look yet - in a figurative sense, you haven't yet found yourself.</span></p>\n<p><span>In contrast, people who have little to no concern for their appearance may tend not to take themselves seriously enough. They are not worth buying new shoes or an expensive trip to the hairdresser.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead, they may have developed a habit of always putting other people, such as their </span><span>children,</span><span> before themselves - even if </span><span>their altruism</span><span> comes at the expense of their own well-being or even health.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/farben-beeinflussen-uns-bei-der-kleidung.jpg\" alt=\"A lady with a cap and sweater in red\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h2><span>Clothing is part of your personality development</span></h2>\n<p><span>These are just a few examples of many, but they already make it clear to what extent clothing can be a reflection of your personality. Every person has different reasons why they approach the topic of outfits or styling in a certain way. It can therefore be interesting to examine your own motives.</span></p>\n<p><span>As superficial as the topic may seem at first glance, it is profound at second glance. Because you will quickly notice how your clothing style changes as your personality matures. Suddenly you might feel confident wearing bolder </span><span>colors</span><span> because you've gained more self-confidence. Or the extra self-love finally allows you to treat yourself to new clothes every now and then and reward yourself for a stressful everyday life.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clothes may not make you a different person, but you can also have an effect on the inside: a new hairdresser might give you more self-acceptance or the new jeans in the perfect fit will make a few pounds appear visually and give you self-confidence and the courage to do so upcoming presentation.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p><span>Here too the list of examples is long. The fact is: internal and external changes go hand in hand. You can't just change something on one level without feeling an effect on the other levels - be it internally, optically, spiritually, externally or energetically.</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>Sustainability</span></h2>\n<p><span>In addition to clothing, bags can also be wonderfully printed and given away as merchandise or sold. More and more people are paying attention to their own sustainability, and jute bags are just as important to use here. </span></p>\n<p><span>They are also used every day and are therefore free advertising space. You can easily </span><span>have jute bags printed</span><span> online and then distribute them to employees and customers. You can also fill them with other goodies for an even better promotional effect. At the same time, reusable bags always do something for the environment, so it's a win-win for everyone.</span></p>\n<div><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span>\n<h2><span>The connection between clothing and Feng Shui</span></h2>\n<p><span>Long story short: There is a direct connection between your choice of clothing and your personality. You will probably always find yourself sorting people into “pigeons” based on their external appearance.</span></p>\n<p><span>The man with the long hair and the band shirt probably likes going to heavy metal concerts and the woman in the perfectly fitting business suit is career-oriented.</span></p>\n<p><span>Such conclusions from the outside to the inside are completely natural - but that doesn't mean that they are always true. But this hasty judgment is a natural mechanism in the brain and you will then subconsciously do everything you can to confirm </span><span>your first impression again and again.</span></p>\n<p><span>Your choice of clothing largely determines how you appear to other people - but also to yourself. And this is exactly where </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> can come into play. This special form is often referred to as Body Feng Shui.</span></p>\n<span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span>\n<h2><span>What is behind the term “Body Feng Shui”?</span></h2>\n<p><span>When it comes to Feng Shui,  </span><span>the focus is on the living spaces</span><span> . However, the teaching can also be applied to many other areas of life - for example health. Body Feng Shui is a continuation of </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> and primarily looks at the impact of clothing on your self-image, well-being, your personality and your life in general.</span></p>\n<p><span>In Body Feng Shui, clothing is also viewed as a kind of </span><span>space</span><span> that surrounds you like a second skin. Strictly speaking, the clothes are much closer to you than the actual room, which could be viewed as a third skin, so to speak.</span></p>\n<p><span>Body Feng Shui is all about well-being in your own body, which includes not only clothing but also your own weight and physical performance. Clothes are not the only important factor in body feng shui, but also your health in general or internal thought patterns and beliefs. But in addition to working on the inside, you can also work on your “second skin” here – your external appearance.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>What are the goals of clothing according to Feng Shui?</span></h2>\n<p><span>According to Feng Shui</span><span> , working on your appearance does n't mean going to a plastic surgeon or spending a lot of money on cosmetics or going to the hairdresser. Instead, it's about creating a “feel-good space” for yourself through the right styling, which has a positive effect on your well-being, for example through more self-confidence or simply coziness.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because the feeling of a warm and fluffy sweater in winter, the cozy sneakers that carry you lightly through life, or the hat that gives you a feeling of security - they all increase your well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clothing can therefore be a comfort zone. It protects you from danger, keeps you warm on cold days and determines how your body feels. It therefore creates a strong energetic effect.</span></p>\n<h2><span>A look at the energetic effect of clothes</span></h2>\n<p><span>If clothing is viewed based on the </span><span>teachings of Feng Shui</span><span> , the same rules apply to it as to </span><span>rooms</span><span> . Because as you already know, your clothes represent, so to speak, the smallest room in which you find yourself. It is therefore important to choose </span><span>the colors</span><span> , fabrics and cuts carefully. Similar rooms are the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> , the Feng Shui living room, the </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span></p>\n<p><span>On the one hand, the visual appearance determines the energetic effect your clothing has on you and those around you. On the other hand, as already mentioned, clothing also largely influences your well-being and therefore </span><span>your body language</span><span> and your energetic charisma.</span></p>\n<h4><span>To clarify, use the following example:</span></h4>\n<p><span>For example, if you wear clothing that is too tight, uncomfortable shoes, or heavy jewelry around your neck, you may feel uncomfortable in your skin. You adopt a crouched and stiff posture, walk unsteadily or breathe heavily. This not only affects your well-being, but also your impact on other people.</span></p>\n<p><span>With the right or wrong clothing, you can actively control both your image of others and your well-being. According to the </span><span>laws of psychosomatics,</span><span> ill-fitting or uncomfortable clothing can even have a negative impact on you on a psychological level.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Choosing clothing from an “energetic” perspective</span></h2>\n<p><span>Fortunately, this mechanism also works in the other direction. So if you choose the “right” clothing, it strengthens you on all levels. You feel more comfortable, walk more upright, feel more self-confident, appear more likeable - this list of positive effects could go on.</span></p>\n<p><span>You probably know the feeling from your own experience: If you're wearing your favorite clothes or dressed up for a special occasion, you feel much better and more confident. You appear differently, approach people more openly and feel like you have grown two meters. You feel a kind of inner radiance, inner power, inner passion - or whatever you want to call this energy.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, this positive energetic effect should not remain an isolated case. Instead, you can and should make these every day as you get dressed and ready for the day ahead. If you want to choose the “right” clothing from an energetic perspective, the following factors play an important role:</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Fit</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The fit of a piece of clothing has a big impact on how comfortable you feel in it. For example, there are short, medium-length or long dresses. You can wear a sweater with a neckline or a turtleneck. Tops for summer are available as T-shirts or tops with thin spaghetti straps. And when it comes to jeans, there are now </span><span>different fits for every type and style</span><span> , from skinny jeans to high waist, ankle or slim fit jeans to mom jeans or baggy pants .</span></p>\n<p><span>To some extent, the question of fit is of course a matter of taste. While some feel more comfortable in tight-fitting clothing, others prefer the cozy “oversized look”. The main thing is that the clothing does not have any unpleasant pressure points. Sometimes the waistband of your pants digs into your stomach when you sit, or the bracelet is too tight and leaves red welts on your wrist.</span></p>\n<p><span>No matter what type of clothing and accessories you ultimately choose: they have to fit so well that you feel completely comfortable - without the need to tug, pull, expand...</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Proportions</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When it comes to the fit, it is also important that the proportions are correct. This does have more of an impact on the visual impact of the clothing, but it will certainly make you feel more comfortable. Choosing the right clothing gives you the opportunity to conceal alleged “problem areas” or to achieve a desired effect – for example, appearing taller or stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you choose loose clothing, it automatically makes you appear slimmer but less feminine. Men look a little more masculine if they have a slim figure. You can also visually reduce your height by wearing loose clothing.</span></p>\n<p><span>In contrast, tight-fitting clothes make you appear taller. They emphasize your curves, for example the décolleté in women or the muscles on the upper arms in men. Depending on the fit, the jeans narrow or widen your hips or thighs, and shoulder pads make you appear more confident and stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span>By consciously selecting your clothing items, you can freely model your proportions as you wish and thus adapt them perfectly to the respective occasion. Do you want to feel strong and confident at work, but want to appear feminine on a date or appear taller as a man? The possibilities are diverse and you can therefore positively influence your visual impact, as well as your own well-being, with the correct modeling of the proportions.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Color</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>From an energetic perspective, color plays a very important role when choosing clothing. You probably already know </span><span>how colors work</span><span> from </span><span>classic Feng Shui</span><span> . You can also apply many of the basic rules that apply there to clothing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clear and pure colors are recommended. A pure white, for example, or a bright yellow. Natural tones have a particularly relaxing effect on the body - even if they are below the surface, i.e. out of sight. Even your choice of underwear affects your energy.</span></p>\n<p><span>It makes sense to put your entire outfit together every morning and adapt it perfectly to the day ahead. Whether you're going to </span><span>work</span><span> and have an important meeting or running around on the playground with your </span><span>kids</span><span> , your intentions make a big difference to your color choice.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is also important to adapt the colors to the season and </span><span>your color type</span><span> . In winter, warm colors also make you feel warmer, while cold colors promise visual cooling in summer. Dark-haired people can wear light colors to compensate. Light-haired people can choose fresh but slightly darkened tones.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Pattern</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>For example, if you want more concentration at </span><span>work , you can choose the yellow sweater, but if you want to play with the </span><span>children</span><span> , choose the light blue sweater that exudes lightness. You are welcome to combine </span><span>colors</span><span> but also in patterns. However, avoid destructive patterns or symbols.</span></p>\n<p><span>Similar to pictures in the </span><span>apartment</span><span> , the motifs should be positive. Knives, cracks, roses with thorns, heavy rivets or other burdensome decorations should be avoided because they weaken you on an energetic level. Therefore, choose positive and uplifting patterns and symbols - or, if in doubt, choose plain-colored items of clothing that radiate calm.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Materials</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>If you choose dyed clothing, it should ideally be dyed using natural products. Naturalness is the be-all and end-all when selecting materials. It doesn't necessarily have to be natural fibers, but rather it depends on the processing. Natural textiles can also be contaminated with harmful substances.</span></p>\n<p><span>So choose natural and carefully processed materials such as cotton that feel comfortable on the skin. However, heavy items of clothing such as a leather jacket or platform shoes should be avoided. Also make sure that the material does not scratch or chafe.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Agility</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The type of materials also determines their mobility. For example, skinny jeans must be made from special stretch fabric to ensure you have the freedom of movement you need.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because movement is an important keyword: the “right” clothing supports you in your movements. Clothes should not restrict your mobility and therefore paralyze you on an energetic level.</span></p>\n<p><span>Before you decide for or against a piece of clothing, it makes sense to test it to see if you can move freely in it. Sitting, standing, running, jumping – all activities must be possible without any problems, without you feeling any resistance or any other form of impairment. This is the only way the energy can flow freely.</span></p>\n<h3><strong><span>Protection</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Finally, according to </span><span>Feng Shui,</span><span> clothing always means protection. The right shoes prevent cuts from broken glass or the hat protects you from the cold. For example, trousers with tears or tops and dresses with “cut-outs”, i.e. deliberately inserted holes, which are currently very trendy, are not recommended. Such clothing creates an uneven sensation of warmth and leaves some important energy centers unprotected.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead, you can consciously protect such energy centers or strengthen them by choosing the right clothing. For example, a collar or scarf protects the throat chakra, high-waisted jeans protects your sacral chakra, or a low-slung hat protects the third eye. So if you feel a special need for protection due to challenges such as a difficult conversation, you can strengthen your well-being by wearing appropriate clothing and approach the situation more confidently.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-11\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>Conclusion on body feng shui and clothing</span></h2>\n<p><span>You see: </span><span>Classic Feng Shui</span><span> cannot be applied one-to-one to clothing. However, many of the basic rules can also be transferred to this. Be it the color effect or the symbolism - Body Feng Shui transfers the traditional approach to your physical well-being and helps you to increase it through the right choice of clothing.</span></p>\n<p><span>From now on you will most likely pay more attention to your choice of outfit and its effect on your well-being. It also makes sense to continue to take a look at yourself at regular intervals and ask yourself questions such as: Has my style changed in the last few weeks or months? If yes, to what extent? What does this mean for my personal development? Where have I made progress? And where not (yet)?</span></p>\n<p><span>If you take a closer look, the topic of clothing is by no means superficial, but rather says a lot about yourself - and can do a lot of good if you use body feng shui correctly!</span></p>\n</div>",

The nuances from nature symbolize reliability and steadfastness. At the same time, they can  </span><strong><span>convey a feeling of security</span></strong><span> . The materials that, according to the theory of harmony, allow positive energy to flow include ceramics, clay, terracotta and stone.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Wood:</span></strong><span>  Areas of life that can be attributed to wood should be designed in shades of green. Natural materials such as wood, bamboo or paper predominate here. You can also work your room with painted, printed or photographed natural scenes, the viewing of which  </span><strong><span>promotes inner peace and triggers positive emotions</span></strong><span> . Looking at plants or water also helps to cope with stress.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Water</span></strong><span> : The color of the sea matches the water: blue. Light or dark shades of blue are used by many people as  </span><strong><span>a symbol of peace, relaxation and gentleness.</span></strong><span>  In addition to water surfaces, glass and mirrors symbolize the gentle and wild element.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Fire:</span></strong><span>  In rooms marked by fire, leather and plastics can predominate as materials. Colors that match this powerful element are purple, orange and reds. Although the latter put the subconscious on alert, they also represent strong emotions.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Metal:</span></strong><span>  The fifth element in  </span><span>Feng Shui </span><span> is metal, to which the material of the same name is assigned. Neutral colors such as white and gray have a calming effect on the eye and mood.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>This interplay of materials and  </span><span>colors</span><span>  in the rooms creates a feel-good atmosphere in your home thanks to the resulting harmonious look. This can help you block out the stress of everyday life and   relax, </span><strong><span>freed from conscious and subconscious stress .</span></strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>How does Feng Shui affect your own well-being?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The term “ </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> ”, like  </span><strong><span>the theory of harmony</span></strong><span>  itself, which is thousands of years old, comes from Chinese. It translates as “wind” and “water”. Feng Shui aims to  </span><strong><span>harmonize people with their surroundings</span></strong><span>  . Through the harmonious arrangement of the elements and the associated design of your living space, you direct your Qi in positive directions. This in turn should help you cope with physical and mental stress as well as inner restlessness.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Stress consciously experienced as a burden on the body and mind</span></h2>\n<p><span>Temporary stressful situations burden those affected on two levels: physically and psychologically. The </span><span>study “Relax, Germany!”</span><span> published in 2021   by the Techniker Krankenkasse provides an overview of  </span><strong><span>the frequency of health consequences caused by stress</span></strong><span> . Respondents who often felt stressed said they suffered from:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Exhaustion (80 percent)</span></li>\n<li><span>Nervousness (62 percent)</span></li>\n<li><span>Sleep problems (52 percent)</span></li>\n<li><span>Headaches and migraines (40 percent)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>34 percent of the study participants said they felt low or even depressed due to frequent stressful situations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Acute stress puts the body on alert. However, the symptoms that occur usually subside once you overcome the challenging situation. </span></p>\n<p><span>The situation is different with inner restlessness, which can become a  </span><strong><span>permanent side effect in everyday life</span></strong><span>  . Persistent stress in private and professional areas is one of the  </span><span>causes of inner restlessness</span><span> , constant tension and nervousness.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Unknown danger: subconscious stress caused by a disharmonious environment</span></h2>\n<p><span>One of the subconscious factors that influence your mental well-being is the design of your living space. A chaotic or untidy environment will make you feel restless and tense at home. Instead of relaxation, another stress factor awaits you in your own four walls  </span><span>, which, according to a study, deprives you of your feeling of security</span><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span>You can avoid subconscious stress in your own home by redesigning your environment. If you pay attention to the teachings of wind and water, you can  </span><strong><span>optimize your energy flow and thus find peace more easily</span></strong><span> . The  </span><span>individual furnishing of your living space</span><span>  has a positive influence on your quality of life for several reasons:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>The perceived self-efficacy when designing your living space increases your self-confidence</span></li>\n<li><span>The individual design of your environment helps you to develop your personality</span></li>\n<li><span>Active tidying up and rearranging can distract you from the constantly circling carousel of thoughts</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>At the same time, you can get to know new sides of yourself and engage with them through the conscious choice of color and style for your furnishings.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The influence of Sheng Qi and Sha Qi on your well-being</span></h2>\n<p><span>In Chinese harmony, a distinction is made between Sheng Qi and Sha Qi. While the latter is mentally draining and disrupts your inner balance,  </span><strong><span>Sheng Qi is life-giving</span></strong><span> . The so-called “dragon breath” is said to have a positive effect on all your senses and thereby stabilize your physical and mental health.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rough edges and untidy structures are considered Sha Qi. This is more prevalent in some apartments than in others. For example  , according to Feng Shui theory, anyone who </span><span>suffers from Messi Syndrome</span><span> is also burdened by a preponderance of Sha Qi within their own four walls.  This disturbing energy can also manifest itself in your  </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> ,  </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span>  or even in the  </span><span>Feng Shui children's room through unfavorable, disharmonious furnishings.</span></p>",

In this context, wall design plays a central role because walls not only surround us; they define the space and have a significant influence on our well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span>Below you will discover how you can use targeted measures in your wall design to create a home that is not only visually appealing, but also energetically in harmony with your needs.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The basics of your Feng Shui wall design</span></h2>\n<p><span>Feng Shui, a profound philosophy originating in Chinese culture, aims to bring harmony and balance to people's living spaces. An essential element of this practice is the </span><span>careful design of the walls</span><span> , which not only define the physical space but also act as carriers of energetic potentials.</span></p>\n<p><span>Wall design according to </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> follows the principle of balance of the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements, represented by </span><span>colors</span><span> and materials, interact with each other and therefore directly influence the well-being and energy in a room.</span></p>\n<p><span>Harmonizing these elements requires a deep understanding of the meaning of colors and their effect on people. For example , shades of green that represent the </span><span>wood element</span><span> promote growth and renewal, while shades of blue that represent the water element bring calm and relaxation to a room. Each color and material contributes in a unique way to shaping the atmosphere of a room and supporting its energetic flow.</span></p>\n<p><span>A significant innovation in the area of ​​Feng Shui wall design is bio-active wall paints, which have become more important in recent years. These colors, developed based on the latest research, go far beyond aesthetic function.</span></p>\n<p><span>They actively improve air quality by breaking down </span><span>pollutants</span><span> and thus contribute to a healthier living environment. This innovative concept combines traditional wisdom with modern technology and opens up new ways to implement the principles of Feng Shui in contemporary living spaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>Consciously choosing colors and materials according to the teachings of Feng Shui allows you to create spaces that are both visually appealing and a source of positive energy and harmony. Bio-active wall paints represent the bridge between ancient wisdom and modern science, a fusion that has the potential to profoundly transform your living space.</span></p>\n<p><span>By integrating these elements into your home during a </span><span>Feng Shui consultation,</span><span> you create a place of balance and well-being that honors and advances the foundations of Feng Shui in an innovative way.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Choose wall coverings carefully</span></h2>\n<p><span>A particular challenge in wall design is choosing the right material. This brings into focus the question of whether wallpapering woodchip on woodchip is a wise decision. There is no general answer to this, but the site offers valuable insights and practical advice that can help you make a decision.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-1024x683.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Six points to consider include:</span></h2>\n<p><span>1. The quality of your existing wallpaper layer is crucial for the result of the wall design. A high-quality, well-preserved layer of wallpaper forms the optimal basis for further beautification measures. However, if the existing wallpaper is damaged or of poor quality, this could affect the overall look and require additional work to create a harmonious basis for the new design.</span></p>\n<p><span>2. The texture of your new woodchip wallpaper plays an important role in the atmosphere and energy structure in the room. Woodchip wallpapers, known for their robustness and textural diversity, allow a wide range of design options. When choosing, you should make sure that the structure and weight of the wallpaper harmonize with the spatial conditions and the intended style.</span></p>\n<p><span>3. The desired effect in the room significantly influences the selection of materials and </span><span>colors</span><span> . Feng Shui aims to create an environment that meets your personal needs and desired mood. Whether you want a calming oasis of relaxation or an invigorating and inspiring </span><span>workspace</span><span> , every decision should serve these goals.</span></p>\n<p><span>4. Compatibility with the principles of Feng Shui is essential to ensure a positive energy flow and harmony. The choice of wallpaper and its properties should support the balance of the five elements, creating a space that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also contributes to well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span>5. The longevity and ease of care of your wallpaper are practical aspects that should not be underestimated. High-quality wallpapers not only promise an attractive look for years to come, but are also easier to clean and replace if necessary. This ensures that your home remains a source of joy and comfort well into the future.</span></p>\n<p><span>6. The ecological impact of your choice of wallpaper is becoming increasingly important. In line with the principles of Feng Shui and the growing need for sustainable action, you should choose wallpapers that are produced in an environmentally friendly manner and contain healthy, low-pollutant materials. This consideration not only helps protect our planet; it also promotes a healthy living environment and increases the positive energy in the room.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Wall displays as a smart solution</span></h2>\n<p><span>An innovative development in wall design in recent years is digital wall displays, which make it possible to dynamically change the aesthetics of a room. These state-of-the-art displays can display landscapes, artwork or calming patterns that can be changed as desired. They allow the atmosphere of a room to be adapted to the mood or occasion, promoting positive energy and creating a unique connection between digital technology and the principles of Feng Shui for a harmonious home.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Conclusion: A home in harmony with Feng Shui</span></h2>\n<p><span>Wall design according to the principles of Feng Shui transforms rooms into sources of positive energy and well-being. By consciously selecting colors, materials and the latest technologies in wall coverings, you can create an environment that is not only visually appealing, but also works on a deeper, energetic level. The integration of elements such as bio-active colors or wall displays marks the beginning of a new era in harmonious interior design that promotes health and happiness.</span></p>",

When these elements are in balance, Qi, the life energy, flows freely and supports a harmonious environment. This balance can be achieved through the correct use of colors, shapes and materials.</span></p>\n<p><span>Balance, on the other hand, means that all aspects are in a harmonious relationship with one another. This can be achieved through the use of </span><span>colors</span><span> and textures as well as maintaining a neat and organized environment.</span></p>\n<p><span>When we cultivate harmony and balance in our everyday lives and mental well-being, we feel balanced and fulfilled. Feng Shui offers us tools and principles to achieve this harmony in all areas of our lives - including the wardrobe.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Energetic influences of clothing</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The principles of Feng Shui emphasize the interaction between our external environment and our internal energy, viewing clothing as a means of expressing and influencing our energetic vibrations.</span></p>\n<p><span>The materials our clothing is made from can have an energetic effect. Natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and silk are often preferred in Feng Shui as they provide a connection to nature and provide a calming and harmonizing energy. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, can restrict the flow of energy as they may not have the same natural connection and energetic quality.</span></p>\n<p><span>Symbols and patterns on clothing can have another level of energetic meaning. In Feng Shui, certain symbols are </span><span>often viewed as good luck charms</span><span> and positive amplifiers. Wearing clothing with these symbols can help attract positive energy and promote a feeling of happiness and prosperity. However, it is important to ensure that the symbols are authentic and do not represent cultural appropriation.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Fraben-pink-1024x576.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>The role of colors</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Color psychology plays a central role in Feng Shui. Colors have a strong emotional and energetic effect on us and can influence our mood, energy and well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span>Red is a powerful and dynamic color that is associated with fire and passion in Feng Shui. It symbolizes happiness, energy and vitality and can help increase our motivation and enliven our actions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Blue is a calming and relaxing color associated with water and sky. It represents calm, clarity and communication and helps to reduce stress and create a peaceful atmosphere. In Feng Shui, blue is often used in bedrooms to promote a restful night's sleep - so it's conceivable that blue could also be used in dressing rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span>Green is the color of nature and life. It is associated with wood and growth and symbolizes harmony, balance and healing. Green can help create a </span><span>deeper connection with nature</span><span> and support our inner balance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yellow is a warm and inviting color associated with sunshine and happiness. It is associated with joy, optimism and communication and can therefore help to lift our mood or improve our mental clarity.</span></p>\n<p><span>White is a neutral and cleansing color that represents metal and clarity in Feng Shui. It symbolizes purity, clarity and order - ideal for the wardrobe area. However, too much of it can create an atmosphere that is too sterile or impersonal. Therefore, it is important to balance it with warmer colors.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Practical tips for organization</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Decluttering and organizing is an important step in creating a home that promotes calm and balance. By getting rid of unnecessary items and organizing our possessions, we can not only create physical space, but also experience mental clarity and emotional release. This applies to the living space, such as the </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> , the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> as well as the wardrobe.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Clearing out and clearing out</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Before you start </span><span>decluttering</span><span> , it is important to set clear goals and define what result you want to achieve. Decluttering can seem overwhelming, especially if you have large amounts of possessions. So start with small steps and focus on a small area or category of clothing. For example, you can start with one drawer and then work your way up little by little.</span></p>\n<p><span>An effective method for decluttering is the crate method. Set out different boxes or containers and label them with the following labels: Keep, Donate/Sell, and Throw Away.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sort each item into one of the corresponding boxes. When decluttering, it's helpful to ask yourself whether each item of clothing has real value to you. If you're unsure, consider whether you've used it in the last six to twelve months and whether you'll use it in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span>Decluttering is not a one-time process but requires ongoing attention and care. This way, you can keep clutter at bay and create a closet that brings you joy and satisfaction.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Konmari method and its application in the wardrobe</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>The Konmari method was developed by Japanese tidying expert Marie Kondo and has gained popularity worldwide. It offers a holistic approach to decluttering and organizing. Using the Konmari method, especially in your wardrobe, can help you create order, increase your enjoyment of your own wardrobe and develop a sustainable relationship with clothing.</span></p>\n<p><span>To get a comprehensive overview of your wardrobe, take all the clothes out of the closet, drawers, and other storage areas and put them in a large pile. This step allows you to see everything you own and make an informed decision about what you want to keep.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Konmari Method emphasizes the importance of joy as a criterion for keeping items. If a piece of clothing doesn't bring you joy or has no practical use, thank it and pass it on or throw it away.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Konmari Method emphasizes the importance of storing clothes carefully to extend their lifespan and keep them in good condition. Use appropriate storage solutions such as hangers, drawer organizers, and storage boxes to keep your clothes neat and well-ventilated.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>The principle of the capsule wardrobe</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>A </span><span>capsule wardrobe</span><span> is a minimalist wardrobe that consists of a limited number of high-quality items of clothing that are perfectly coordinated and can be combined with each other to create a variety of outfits.</span></p>\n<p><span>Typically, a capsule wardrobe consists of around 30-50 pieces, including outerwear, bottoms, tops, shoes and accessories. The goal is to create a wardrobe that is versatile, timeless and functional. The advantages are apparent:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Time Saving:</span></strong><span> Reducing the number of clothes in your closet makes morning decision-making easier.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Space saving:</span></strong><span> A capsule wardrobe requires less storage space, which creates space and order in the closet.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Money savings:</span></strong><span> By shopping more consciously and focusing on high-quality, timeless clothing, you can save money in the long term.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Sustainability:</span></strong><span> A capsule wardrobe promotes more sustainable consumption as it helps to reduce the consumption of unnecessary items and extend the lifespan of clothing.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Style awareness:</span></strong><span> By focusing on a limited number of items of clothing, you can better define and develop your personal style.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Creating a capsule wardrobe is easy. Start by choosing the basics, including timeless pieces like t-shirts, blouses, jeans, dresses, and jackets. Think about which items of clothing you wear most often and which ones best support your lifestyle. Choose a neutral color palette for your capsule wardrobe that is easy to mix and match and timeless.</span></p>\n<p><span>Consider the seasons and adjust your selection accordingly by adding or removing seasonal pieces. Add new pieces that meet your needs and fit well with your existing wardrobe.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Storage options</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>A neat and well-organized closet can create a positive energetic atmosphere in the room. However, storing clothes doesn't end in the closet.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Using Feng Shui friendly furniture</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Choosing Feng Shui-friendly furniture is an important aspect of creating a comfortable home atmosphere. Furniture pieces with rounded, organic shapes promote a harmonious flow of energy and create a softer, gentler atmosphere in the room.</span></p>\n<p><span>Furniture made from natural materials such as wood, </span><span>bamboo</span><span> , rattan and stone are often preferred as they connect to nature and provide a calming, grounding energy. Avoid furniture made from synthetic materials. Choose furniture pieces with smooth, clean surfaces and avoid excessive embellishments or cluttered designs.</span></p>\n<p><span>The proportions of the furniture pieces should be balanced and fit well into the space without dominating or overwhelming it. Make sure that your pieces of furniture are proportionate to each other and leave enough space for a harmonious flow of energy. The colors of the furniture should be consistent with the principles of color psychology and create a harmonious and balanced atmosphere in the room.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Clever storage solutions for an energetically positive wardrobe</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Open shelves allow you to display your clothes clearly and make it easier to access your favorite items. Choose shelves with clean lines and natural materials to create a calming and supportive atmosphere.</span></p>\n<p><span>Folding your clothes neatly and evenly is also important to promote positive energy in your closet. Use special </span><span>folding techniques like the Konmari method</span><span> to organize your clothes neatly and in a space-saving manner.</span></p>\n<p><span>Drawer organizers help you organize the contents of your drawers neatly and keep track of your clothes. Choose organizers with different compartments and sections to sort your clothes in a targeted manner.</span></p>\n<p><span>High-quality hangers keep your clothes looking good and can help promote positive energy in the closet. Choose hangers made from natural materials like wood or bamboo and avoid metal hangers, which could potentially create unwanted energy.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>The importance of accessories and details</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>By applying the principles of Feng Shui to jewelry, bags, and shoes, you can promote supportive and harmonious energy in your daily life.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Jewelry, bags and shoes according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>In Feng Shui, jewelry is often viewed as an amplifier for positive energy. Keep it in a well-organized and tidy environment. Avoid leaving jewelry lying around in large quantities as this can hinder the flow of energy. Choose jewelry made from natural materials such as </span><span>gemstones</span><span> , wood, and metals.</span></p>\n<p><span>The situation is similar with handbags. They are more than just a practical accessory - they carry our personal belongings and therefore our energy. Choose handbags in colors that support an energy and intentions. Make sure it is not too big and does not hinder the flow of energy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Shoes</span><span> play an important role in Feng Shui as they represent our connection to the earth and provide an energetic connection to our home. They represent our stability, our advancement and our protection from the external influences of the world. Therefore, it is important to treat shoes with respect and give them an appropriate place in your home. A neat and well-organized shoe rack is crucial for creating positive energy in the room.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Importance of materials</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>In Feng Shui, the selection of accessories is evaluated based on their energetic properties. The materials from which accessories are made play a crucial role in creating a harmonious and balanced environment. By integrating the five elements – wood, fire, earth, metal and water – into the materials, accessories can promote well-being.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>Wood:</span></strong><span> Wood represents the element of growth, vitality and new beginnings. Wooden accessories such as bracelets, necklaces or earrings can radiate a warm and calming energy and create a connection to nature. Choose accessories made from natural woods such as cedar, birch or mahogany to promote the harmonious energy of the wood element.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Fire:</span></strong><span> Fire symbolizes passion, energy and enthusiasm. Accessories made from fiery materials such as rose gold, amber or gemstones such as rubies or carnelians can create a lively and dynamic energy in the room. Wear accessories with fiery colors and shiny finishes to support the energy.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Earth:</span></strong><span> Earth stands for stability and down-to-earthness. Accessories made from earthy materials such as clay, ceramic or stone can create a calming and balancing energy. Accessories in earth tones such as brown, beige or terracotta strengthen the energetic connection to the earth element.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Metal:</span></strong><span> Metal represents clarity, precision and focus. Accessories made from metallic materials such as silver, gold or stainless steel can radiate an elegant and sophisticated energy in the room. Wear accessories with clean lines and geometric shapes to emphasize the energetic quality.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Water: </span></strong><span>The element water</span><span> symbolizes flow, movement and flexibility. Accessories made from flowing materials such as silk, satin or glass can promote a gentle and calming energy. Choose accessories in shades of blue or turquoise or with organic shapes to support the energy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>To create a harmonious connection with the five elements, accessories made from different materials and colors can be combined. For example, you can wear a wooden bead necklace with a flint pendant or combine leather bracelets with metal beads.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-5\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Integrate Feng Shui into everyday life</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>By integrating Feng Shui routines into our daily lives, we can promote positive energy, create balance and increase our well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span>Start your day with a short </span><span>meditation</span><span> or moment of mindfulness to align yourself with positive energy and intentions. Take a deep breath and visualize yourself approaching the day with calm, serenity and success. Practice gratitude by consciously focusing on the positive aspects of your life and expressing gratitude for them.</span></p>\n<p><span>Make it a habit to clean and ventilate your living space every morning. Clean up, open windows for fresh air, and use cleansing practices like incense or essential oils to remove negative energies.</span></p>\n<p><span>End the day with a ritual that helps you calm down and relax. Read a book or do a short meditation to let go of the day's stress and prepare for a restful sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span>By incorporating these daily Feng Shui routines into your everyday life, you can create a supportive environment that brings balance to your life. Remember that it is important to adapt routines to your own needs and preferences and to consciously focus on the positive aspects of life.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span>The </span><span>rental apartment</span><span> market is currently very competitive. This can be attributed primarily to the high building interest rates. This has caused many people to abandon their plan to own their own home and continue to rent.</span></p>\n<p><span>In many places, the demand for apartments exceeds the existing supply. The situation is particularly tense in the country's popular cities and metropolitan areas. Those looking for a new rental property often have to make compromises.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, when looking for an apartment, it helps to consider some of the basics of Feng Shui. These significantly increase the chances of getting a real dream apartment. If the apartment meets certain requirements right from the start, the probability is much higher that you will really feel comfortable in it and can benefit from the positive energies.</span></p>\n<p><span>The following article explains which Feng Shui principles play a role in the search for your dream apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The floor plan</span></h2>\n<p><span>The floor plan of an apartment can always be divided into a total of eight cardinal directions. These each come with a different energy quality. If a cardinal direction is missing, for example because it is an L-shaped apartment, the corresponding energies of the cardinal direction are not present. This means that you cannot benefit from them and no negative energy can come from them.</span></p>\n<p><span>If the positive energies in an apartment are not shown to be complete, this can have a major impact on overall well-being. For example, a cardinal direction based on personal values ​​feeds the energy of making money. It can therefore be very disadvantageous if this area is not available in the potential new apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ideally, the apartment has a square or rectangular floor plan. To find such a property in the south of the country, the </span><span>real estate expert in Ingolstadt</span><span> is the right contact.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Arrangement of windows and entrance doors</span></h2>\n<p><span>The positive energy, the Qi, always enters the interior through the front door. However, if there is a window directly opposite the entrance door, there is a risk that this positive energy will immediately leave the apartment through the window. It is not possible to keep the energy in the rooms. So this cannot be used for your own benefit. However, there are also remedies to keep the Qi and let it flow through the rooms.</span></p>\n<p><span>The teaching of temporal Feng Shui also assumes that the majority of energy occurs in the area where the apartment opens. However, this area does not necessarily have to be the entrance door. It can also be the side of the apartment where there are a lot of </span><span>windows and a spacious patio door.</span></p>\n<p><span>The front door often leads into a rather dark hallway. This is generally avoided by the Qi, as this area of ​​the home is hardly particularly inviting for positive energy.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Arrangement of entrance door and bathroom</span></h2>\n<p><span>However, it's not just the arrangement of the entrance door and windows that matters, but also the placement of the </span><span>bathroom</span><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span>The positive energy would also quickly disappear in the toilet or bathroom. Those who do not want to do without Qi in their own four walls should therefore make sure that the bathroom is not located directly below the entrance door.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The center of the apartment</span></h2>\n<p><span>In Feng Shui, the center of the apartment is called Tai Qi. This is an important collection point for energy. Above all, the prevailing basic energies are concentrated in the center of the apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span>For this reason, it is very important that the center of the apartment is always freely accessible and walkable. In order to determine exactly where the Tai Qi is located in the respective apartment, a line must be drawn from the bottom right to the top left in the floor plan. An additional line is then drawn from the bottom left to the top right. The center of the apartment is at the point where the two lines meet.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The incidence of light</span></h2>\n<p><span>If the potential new apartment is only provided with a small amount of natural </span><span>light</span><span> , Feng Shui usually suffers. A sufficiently bright apartment is important, otherwise the energy will quickly find another place.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>The house entrance</span></h2>\n<p><span>The entrance area to the apartment plays an essential role when it comes to the positive energies in the rooms. In this case, it is very important that there is </span><span>order</span><span> . Feng Shui followers will already be familiar with the phrase that energy always follows attention.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, if the garbage cans are left open in front of the entrance to the house, the flowers in the front garden are dry and the paving slabs are damaged, this is hardly attractive for the energy. A messy entrance to the house can prevent energy from finding its way into the apartment.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nobody wants to live in a house without energy. That's why the entrance to the house should also be given the necessary attention when viewing.</span></p>\n<p><span>When it comes to the entrance to the house, there is something else to consider in addition to the basic order and first impression. In some houses the entrance is not visible at first glance. So you have to look for this for a long time. However, this also confuses the Qi to a great extent - the energy cannot orient itself this way.</span></p>\n<p><span>In order to direct the Qi into the apartment, it is important that the doorbell signs are clearly labeled and there is sufficient lighting in the entrance area. The house number should also be easy to recognize.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>These things are important before moving</span></h2>\n<p><span>It's not just poorly ventilated rooms and dark corners that attract negative energy, Sha Qi. The same applies to rooms that are too crowded or untidy. Once you have finally found your new dream apartment, you should definitely take advantage of the opportunity and clean it out properly. Although this may involve a certain amount of effort, it is still worth it.</span></p>\n<p><span>If the new apartment does not comply with the Feng Shui principles in all respects, this is no reason to despair. There are still numerous measures that can be taken to optimize the energy flow in the new home. This includes, for example, a careful selection of colors for the walls.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span>Feng shui is not just about coordinating the interior design of a room.</span><br><span>The Far Eastern furnishing technology sometimes comes into play in the floor plan. A  </span><span>Feng Shui renovation</span><span>  can include smaller, simple measures that can achieve a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are also more complex renovation measures that involve planning a room from scratch or even changing the floor plan. However, such measures are not entirely cost-effective and require financing. The following article explains how this can be achieved.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>What does renovating mean?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Renovation means changing the basic appearance of a house. This includes painting and painting in certain colors, repairing furniture or furnishings and refinishing floor coverings.</span></p>\n<p><span>The aim is to improve the visual condition of the property in order to feel more comfortable in it and, if necessary, to be able to sell it more profitably later.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the spirit of Feng Shui, renovating can be used  to  improve </span><span>the quality of life at home</span><span> . The term modernization is often used in the same context.</span></p>\n<p><span>Modernization is about bringing the property up to date. This means, for example, energy-saving heaters or new, well-insulating windows are installed.</span></p>\n<p><span>While you can usually carry out renovation work yourself at home, extensive modernizations usually require the help of specialist personnel. Accordingly, they are also significantly more expensive.</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Renovation and conversion work in the sense of Feng Shui could include the following things:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Plan rooms from scratch, taking into account cardinal points and interference zones, for example</span></li>\n<li><span>Change and redefine the function of the rooms, tailored to lighting conditions, cardinal directions and expanded Feng Shui principles</span></li>\n<li><span>Adjust furnishings accordingly, rearrange or buy new ones</span></li>\n<li><span>Pull in or tear down walls to connect rooms or create smaller spaces</span></li>\n<li><span>Install or reglaze windows to improve energy efficiency and lighting conditions</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Basically, the more you know in advance about planned renovation work, the better you can calculate the costs that will arise later. These in turn influence which types of financing are suitable.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>How much does a Feng Shui renovation cost?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>It is not possible to say in general terms how much it will cost to renovate your living space, as the costs depend on many factors:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>How large is the living space that needs to be changed?</span></li>\n<li><span>How much is done in-house and how much is given to specialist staff?</span></li>\n<li><span>How extensive are the renovations?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The basic value for a comprehensive renovation of a house should be around 600 euros per square meter.</span><br><span>This means that for an area of ​​100 square meters it costs around 60,000 euros.</span></p>\n<p><span>Due to their smaller size, apartments are usually a little cheaper to renovate, so you can expect to spend around 500 euros per square meter.</span><br><span>The good thing, however, is that the need for renovation doesn't happen overnight. You usually know long in advance that something needs to be done and can prepare accordingly financially.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>How do you finance the renovation?</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Fortunately, there are a number of options for financing renovation work. One variant is   to use a </span><span>building savings contract for renovations .</span></p>\n<p><span>In such a building savings contract, you save over the years and on favorable terms until you finally have it paid out for a specific project. If the renovation costs are too high for the contract concluded, you may need to take out an additional loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are three different options: the housing loan, the modernization loan and the installment loan.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>Home loans are an uncomplicated financing option</span></h2>\n<p><span>To get this loan, you just need to prove that you own a property that the loan will be used for. A sum of between 5,000 and 50,000 euros can then be financed with such a loan.</span></p>\n<p><span>A modernization loan, on the other hand, is usually used when the renovation becomes more expensive, as higher amounts are possible. More expensive renovation work can be made possible with such a modernization loan through construction financing.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is a little more complicated because it is secured by a land register entry. But it offers even lower interest rates than the home loan. A solution that is uncomplicated, but less favorable in terms of interest rates, is the free installment loan. This loan is not tied to any purpose. Amounts between 1,000 and 50,000 euros can be financed.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, due to the higher interest rates, this alternative is rarely worthwhile for property owners.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, you sometimes also have the opportunity to take advantage of government funding. This is an option for projects that aim to increase energy efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span>The BAFA (Federal Office of Economics and Export Control), for example, provides  </span><span>subsidies of up to 45 percent</span><span>  of the eligible costs. These grants do not have to be repaid.</span></p>\n<p><span>An alternative is KfW funding from the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau. Cheap development loans can be taken out through KfW, which can be used for sustainable construction projects.</span></p>",

In addition to the most important holiday,  </span><span>Chinese New Year,</span><span>  the People's Republic is also known for its Feng Shui.</span></p>\n<p><span>A theory of harmony that pursues the harmonization of people with their environment and is the central theme of our training and further education.</span></p>\n<p><span>The term Feng Shui means something like “wind and water”. This harmonization occurs through the conscious design of the environment in order to bring it into harmony with the people. Antique vases can therefore also play a role in Feng Shui.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>What's the deal with ancient Chinese vases?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The theory of harmony not only shapes residential design, but also the planning of gravesites and Chinese garden art.</span></p>\n<p><span>Chinese vases are often used here. As is well known, these are available in different designs: These include meter-high floor vases, but also bulbous table vases. In China, people made the first pottery vessels in the south of the country over 20,000 years ago. This laid the foundation for today's pottery. Researchers found the oldest ceramic shards in a cave in  </span><span>Jiangxi Province</span><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span>Even today,  </span><span>ancient Chinese vases</span><span> still exist  in various shapes, colors and materials.</span></p>\n<p><span>China now looks back on a 5,000-year-old tradition: During this period, a large number of high-quality antique Chinese vases made of porcelain, silver or bronze were created. </span></p>\n<p><span>Anyone planning a trip to China should find out about customs regulations before exporting antiques. According to the  </span><span>Federal Foreign Office,</span><span>  antiques are subject to strict regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some of these works must bear the red seal of the Chinese Cultural Administration. The extent to which this applies to antique Chinese vases must be clarified in advance with the relevant authorities so that there are no unpleasant surprises in an emergency.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>What role do (Chinese) vases play in classic Feng Shui?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Vases have various functions in Feng Shui. This is how the tradition of the wealth vase exists.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is about improving your own prosperity. The Chinese fill this vase of wealth with pyrite or gold coins. If you don't have gold coins on hand, you can also fill the ancient Chinese vases with other valuable items.</span></p>\n<p><span> Plants play an important role in traditional Chinese Feng Shui: Among other things, they purify the air, as we have already discussed in more detail in another  </span><span>blog post .</span></p>\n<p><span>Because of this, antique vases are suitable for storing these plants. Vases also have other meanings in Feng Shui. Crystal vases, for example, enhance the elemental effect of water due to the metallic energy that emanates from them (cf. Feng Shui plants bring harmony into the home).</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span>What are famous Chinese vases?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The People's Republic of China is known for its Chinese porcelain. These include the antique Ming vases.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first pieces were created long before the time of the Ming Emperor Yongele (1403 - 1424). These porcelain pieces often stand out because of their blue and white design.</span></p>\n<p><span>The design of these porcelain vases can be characterized by geometric or floral motifs, among other things. The Ming vase is therefore particularly well known outside of China.</span></p>\n<p><span>But it's not just Chinese Ming vases that are richly decorated. Other Chinese vases also feature motifs such as dragons, flowers, dogs, etc. and can be found among collectors.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span>As a theory of harmony, Feng Shui can   be used not only </span><span>in building houses</span><span> , as part of interior design and  </span><span>in garden design</span><span> . The principles can also be used to promote the flow of energy on the terrace.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>In the flow: How Feng Shui works on the terrace</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Feng Shui is always about arranging the five natural elements - symbolized by objects - correctly. On the terrace, these can be a wide variety of items, from comfortable  </span><span>rattan seating groups</span><span>  to plant pots and boxes to decorative items.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, you not only have to align objects outdoors according to Feng Shui recommendations, but you also have to take the proximity to nature into account. This means that surrounding plants must also be selected according to Feng Shui principles for optimal energy flow.</span></p>\n<p><span>As connecting elements to nature, plants do justice to a fundamental aspect of the teaching. They not only clean the air, but also promote the flow of energy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead of one-sidedness such as just lawn, varied planting is preferable. Feng Shui explicitly recommends plants such as money trees and smaller fruit trees for the terrace area.</span></p>\n<p><span>To convey positive feelings, they should bloom as brightly as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span>If plants are located on or adjacent to the terrace, they also need to be looked after. Under no circumstances should they dry out, otherwise they represent one of the most negative elements of the Feng Shui philosophy. In addition to good water drainage, appropriate irrigation can prevent this. If something does dry out, it should be removed from the patio area as quickly as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>1. Colors and light: What is important when designing a terrace according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>According to Feng Shui teachings, light </span><span>colors</span><span> support the flow of energy more than dark shades. Tones such as light blue, orange, yellow and pastel colors are therefore recommended for furniture and decorative items on the terrace.</span></p>\n<p><span>Black and brown, like other dark colors, tend to disrupt harmony. You should keep this in mind, especially when choosing garden furniture.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are always dark color nuances in the area, from the brown of the earth to dark colored leaves in autumn. However, they should be avoided directly on the terrace or in the immediate vicinity.</span></p>\n<p><span>Just like bright colors, Feng Shui also values ​​natural light positively. Ideally, the terrace is aimed at the most illuminated point in the area, which is probably the sun outside. When it comes to roofing, attention should also be paid to light permeability. Pergolas with climbing plants are suitable because the light is not completely blocked by the leaves of the plants. The natural roof also provides wind protection, which is important according to Feng Shui.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Feng Shui expert tip: The right amount of light</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>When sunlight falls, there should be the same brightness everywhere on the terrace. Nowhere should it be too light or too dark. If areas are permanently in shadow, it is best to install lamps or candles there. This is not only good for the energy flow, but also ensures relaxation.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>2. Balance of elements: What this principle means for the terrace</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>According to the teachings of Feng Shui, the five elements have meaning both in closed rooms and in open areas such as the terrace.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because the harmony between wood, earth, metal, water and fire influences how energy manifests itself in the world. If all the elements are present, they harmonize their surroundings.</span></p>\n<p><span>With this goal in mind, they should also appear in a balanced manner on the terrace or at least be symbolized. can be represented</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>the wood associated with warmth and spring, for example through trees, decking or furniture.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>the water associated with change and movement, for example through fountains, bird baths, pools or ponds.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>the earth, which is associated with stable energies, through plant pots, among other things.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>the metal, which is associated with discipline, for example through decorative elements such as table decorations, chimes or wind chimes.</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>the fire associated with power, for example through candles, torches, triangular symbols or fireplaces.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>3. Openness: How the choice of shape on the terrace promotes a healthy flow of energy</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>The theory of shapes in Feng Shui generally advises against sharp-edged objects and objects with right angles.</span></p>\n<p><span>Instead, curved shapes that appear soft and promote the flow of energy are recommended. Garden tools such as spades, shovels and scissors should therefore not be stored on the terrace.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is also better to replace sharp-edged pieces of furniture with round or oval furniture.</span></p>\n<p><span>Weatherproof textiles for the outdoor area</span><span> play   an important role, for example in the form of comfortable blankets, hammocks, upholstery, cushions and carpets. Overall, pieces of furniture should be arranged unevenly so that they do not block energy.</span></p>\n<p><span>According to Feng Shui, energy cannot move freely even on cluttered terraces. Broken, dysfunctional and useless items should definitely be removed. They symbolize a lack of life, which can have a negative impact on terrace guests.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Final tip for patio design according to Feng Shui</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Feng Shui principles also play a role in the orientation of the dining area as well as the loungers and seats. Basically, the wall should always be at your back if possible and in this way can provide protection.</span></p>",
