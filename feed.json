Depending on the color choice, the yin or yang effect of the building can be strengthened. </span></p>\n<p><span>If the goal is a Yin-emphasized facade, blue can be a possible color. But be careful: If a strong earth shape of a property meets the water represented by blue, disharmony can result. The reason is that the earth element absorbs water and destroys its power (also known as a collision). Such collisions are consistently avoided in a </span><span>Feng Shui-</span><span> compliant design, because otherwise unrest in perception or effect arises.</span></p>\n<p><span>To achieve a balanced yin-yang character, all factors must be taken into account. The factors here do not just mean materials and colors, but also the residents who live in the property. It is therefore important to take stock and answer the key question of what the new facade paint should achieve.</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span>Including:</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>To which element can the building be assigned based on its shape?</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>How does the house fit into the surroundings?</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>Which element can the environment be assigned to?</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>Should more energy be directed into the house?</span></strong></li>\n<li><strong><span>Is mediation between the environment and the house desired?</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>When it comes to terraced houses in different colours, it is advisable to carefully consider the interactions. Depending on the colour combinations and house shapes, some houses can benefit from the interaction, while others (and therefore the residents) are negatively influenced.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Even rampant plants climbing along the facade or hanging plants reaching down from a </span><span>balcony</span><span> into the ground floor windows can significantly detract from the overall impression.</span></li>\n<li><span>In order to direct positive, lively energy into the house, the facade color should not only match the surroundings. With the help of strong accents - for example in the form of a front door in a powerful color - the desired energy flows into the building.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The characters of the residents must also be taken into account when making the color scheme. For example, a homeowner who is born under the </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> element ( </span><span>Chinese zodiac sign</span><span> ) of fire will hardly be attracted to a facade that primarily nourishes water elements.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-7dd877b3 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"7dd877b3\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-3a53d846\" data-id=\"3a53d846\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-188fc81 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"188fc81\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<h4 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><span>With Feng Shui advice for new buildings, conflicts can be prevented and a pleasant living experience can be promoted right from the start.</span></h4>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Windows can help with this by bringing fresh air and natural light into the room, thus getting the energy flowing. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, it is important that the windows are in proportion to the other furniture and kept clean to achieve the full potential of Feng Shui. </span></p>\n<p><span>In addition, you should not cover the windows with any curtains.

Round or square windows are particularly harmonious and give the room a gentle and balanced ambience. </span></p>\n<p><span>By choosing the right shape of the windows, you can not only add an aesthetic touch to the room, but also positively influence the energy and balance in the room.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-Fenster.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-357ddc2d elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"357ddc2d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><span>Curtains, blinds and pleated blinds</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-125981a8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"125981a8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<p><span>Window coverings also play an important role in Feng Shui.

It is often used to promote wealth and luck. However, it should be used in moderation as too much red has an overstimulating effect.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Blue</span></strong><span> symbolizes calm, relaxation and serenity. It is often used to calm a room and create a peaceful atmosphere.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Green</span></strong><span> represents growth, renewal and health. It is often used to create a positive flow of energy and a connection to nature.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Yellow</span></strong><span> represents optimism, joy and intellect. The color helps to brighten a room and create a cheerful mood.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Violet</span></strong><span> represents spirituality, wisdom and transformation. It can be used to create a deeper connection to inner peace and the spiritual side.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>White</span></strong><span> symbolizes purity, clarity and openness. It is often used to open up a room and create a neutral, balanced atmosphere.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Black</span></strong><span> represents power, depth and protection. Used in moderation, it conveys elegance and strength. However, when used excessively, it appears gloomy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-daadc7a elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"daadc7a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-53f652ee elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"53f652ee\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\"><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-1\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span>\n<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><span>Shapes are also assigned a specific meaning:</span></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-547a05b3 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"547a05b3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<ul>\n<li><span>The </span><strong><span>circle</span></strong><span> symbolizes unity, harmony and completeness.

At the same time, disturbing noises should be minimized so as not to interrupt the flow of energy.

It is based on the harmony of the cardinal directions with the person. Grandmaster Yap Cheng Hai himself taught me how to use the 8-house formula. He repeatedly showed me its value and importance.</span></p>\n<p><span>He himself had found the formula book in a library in China around 60 years ago. The forbidden books were sorted out there and kept in a kind of collection. According to him, it was written in southern China. It was a handwritten original from the Qing Dynasty.</span><br><span>He himself studied the work for more than three years in order to understand all the details and applications.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><span>In principle, the application for the most effective Feng Shui system is very simple.</span></pre>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>However, old works are often written in an encrypted or complicated way. This means that only experts can correctly interpret and understand the content. Furthermore, the Chinese language is a figurative language. It leaves a lot of room for possible interpretations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Through his work with friends and clients, Grandmaster Yap Cheng Hai gained another twenty years of experience in this </span><span>Feng Shui technique.</span><span> This led him to realize that this book contained a great treasure. Anyone who understood how to use it could influence problems in the areas of family, business or health. I can confirm its effectiveness through my own experience.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/Feng-Shui-Grundriss.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h2><span>What is the most effective Feng Shui system?</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span>The Feng Shui of the 8 houses is based on the personal birth data as well as the location and orientation of the </span><span>house.</span></li>\n<li><span>Its goal is to find and use the best directional energies of each person and to avoid the bad ones.</span></li>\n<li><span>Each person reacts in different ways to the forces of different directions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong><span>Learn how to give yourself targeted advice in my Feng Shui course “Be your own Feng Shui consultant”.</span></strong></em></p>\n<h3><span>Method</span></h3>\n<p><span>In order to be able to use Ba Zhai for yourself, you first need to understand how the </span><span>Chinese calendar</span><span> works . Every qualified </span><span>Feng Shui consultant</span><span> needs a compass but also a calendar.</span><br><span>Unlike the western division of the year, the Chinese calendar is divided into two different types of calculation: namely, the lunar and solar times.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the Western calendar, the New Year always begins on January 1st - unlike the Chinese view. Here, the solar calendar begins the year around February 4th. In the lunar calendar, on the other hand, the year begins according to the phases of the moon.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<h4><span>In Feng Shui,</span><span> the solar calendar is used exclusively for most important calculations.</span></h4>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Thus, the year usually begins on February 4th, sometimes also on February 3rd or 5th. All people born before February 4th usually still belong to the previous year.</span></p>\n<p><span>The birth times can be compared using the table below. However, for the assessment it is important to know that this system is based on the solar year. From the table, each person can now be assigned a Gua number. This is needed for the precise assessment in order to determine which areas and directions are most favorable for you.</span></p>\n<p><span>First, find your Gua number from the list below. Note that men and women have a different column. The blue column is for men and boys, the red column is for women and girls. Write down your number!</span></p>\n<h2><span>For the most effective Feng Shui system you need  </span><strong><span>compass measurement</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Authentic Feng Shui deals with the powerful but invisible energies of our environment. The precision compass used by </span><span>Feng Shui consultants</span><span> is called </span><span>Luo Pan</span><span> and helps to understand the energy flow of an area. This enables a qualitative assessment of a place.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/1.-Gua-Foto.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p><span>There are numerous rings on the Luo Pan, from which many Feng Shui formulas can be derived. But there are also references to cardinal directions and their qualities. Of course, it is also possible to use a good, precise compass for the measurement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Unlike Google Earth, </span><span>Feng Shui</span><span> works exclusively with the earth's magnetism. Google Earth and other maps are aligned to geographic north.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>Each direction has its own qualities of Qi</span></h2>\n<p><span>The Chinese name for the Feng Shui system of 8 houses is \"Ba Zhai\". Ba means \"8\" and Zhai means \"house\".</span><br><span>You divide your house into 8 different sectors. But there are actually 9 fields.</span><br><span>You can then place these on your floor plan. This allows you to specifically assess which direction corresponds exactly to your energy, your Qi quality.</span></p>\n<p><span>The middle is not important in this Feng Shui system. You probably already know the basics of Feng Shui, which say: The middle should be free. That is always the basic principle.</span><br><span>That is why it is called 8 houses. Because there are 8 different directions and therefore 8 different sectors to evaluate and not 9. This gives you 8 possibilities for how you interact with your room.</span><br><span>First of all, we will try to find out exactly what the most effective Feng Shui system is.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2><span>Then you can get started.</span></h2>\n<p><span>You have and absolutely need </span><span>a house</span><span> or </span><span>an apartment</span><span> , a kind of enclosure for Qi, so to speak. Next, you need the birth date of the residents; each individual roommate.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because here too, it is important to differentiate carefully. After all, not everyone prefers the same cardinal directions, which can also be an advantage. Just imagine that you might not be able to use some </span><span>rooms because they do not support your energy. Every </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> , </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> and especially a </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span><span> should have good Qi. But perhaps the situation is different for your </span><span>child</span><span> or another family member.</span><br><span>Mark the good areas of your favorable sectors and the corresponding cardinal directions.</span></p>\n<p><span>SE – southeast, NE – northeast, S – south, N – north, W – west, SW – southwest, NW – northwest, E – east.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the first line you will find your Gua number. Below are the cardinal directions. The blue values ​​indicate the good sectors. The red letters represent the bad areas in your house.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Find your good areas in the house or apartment</span></h2>\n<p><span>To easily assess your living space, ask yourself the following questions: Where are your seats? Which room do you spend most of your time in? Is your </span><span>sleeping area</span><span> in a good sector?</span></p>\n<p><span>The following list shows you which places should be in a good sector for you.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the </span><span>Feng Shui bedroom</span><span> and also in the </span><span>Feng Shui children's room,</span><span> the bed is particularly important. So the bed should be in a positive area. Do you often spend time in the </span><span>office</span><span> and make important decisions there? Then </span><span>the desk</span><span> should be in a good sector.</span></p>\n<p><span>Your </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> and especially the place where the couch is located needs good qualities of Qi. This is where you want to recharge your energy and regenerate. This happens best when you and your positive direction interact. Your dining room and the places in the house where you spend a lot of time also need good qualities of Qi.</span></p>",

The name Feng Shui literally translates to </span><strong><span>“wind and water</span></strong><span> ,” and these two elements symbolize the </span><strong><span>flow of energy</span></strong><span> , or </span><strong><span>Qi,</span></strong><span> through our surroundings. It is the art of designing our environment to optimize the <strong>flow of </strong></span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> to promote prosperity, health and harmony. A harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> can also help to relieve or prevent ailments such as </span><span>tension headaches. The fundamentals of Feng Shui are deeply rooted in </span><strong><span>Chinese philosophy</span></strong><span> and the observation of nature. Here are some key concepts you should know:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span>The concept of Qi: </span></strong><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> is the </span><strong><span>life-giving energy</span></strong><span> that flows through everything. A harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> in your </span><span>Feng Shui living room</span><span> or at work can contribute to improved general well-being.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>The Five Elements:</span></strong><span> Feng Shui is based on the theory of the </span><strong><span>five elements</span></strong><span> – wood, fire, earth, metal and water. The balance and interaction of these elements in your environment influences the </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> and thus your well-being.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Yin and Yang:</span></strong><span> The </span><strong><span>balance of Yin and Yang</span></strong><span> , the opposing and complementary forces, is crucial to creating a harmonious environment.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>The Bagua Card:</span></strong><span> The </span><strong><span>Bagua Card</span></strong><span> is a fundamental tool in Feng Shui and helps identify different areas of life and their connection to different parts of your living or working space.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><span>Compass school or form school:</span></strong><span> Feng Shui practices can be divided into </span><strong><span>compass schools</span></strong><span> , which focus on directional energies and time qualities, and </span><strong><span>form schools</span></strong><span> , which focus on the physical design and arrangement of spaces. Both systems should be used in good </span><span>Feng Shui advice .</span></p>\n<p><span>By applying these basics, you can begin to understand and optimize the </span><strong><span>energy flows</span></strong><span> in your environment. Feng Shui offers a rich range of tools and techniques to improve the quality of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> in your living space, creating a </span><strong><span>harmonious and supportive environment</span></strong><span> . Any change, no matter how small, can be a significant step in promoting balance and positive energy in your daily life. The art of Feng Shui can create a deeper connection between you and your living space, which lays the foundation for a </span><strong><span>balanced and healthy life</span></strong><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"elementor-toc__heading-anchor-2\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor \"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Feng Shui to prevent headaches</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>The traditional art of Feng Shui offers a range of tools and techniques that can help you create a </span><strong><span>harmonious environment that promotes </span></strong><strong><span>well-being</span></strong><span> . This harmony can have a positive effect on </span><strong><span>preventing headaches</span></strong><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span>By consciously designing your living and work spaces, you can create a supportive space that can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. In the following sections, I will discuss the key aspects of </span><strong><span>room design</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>color therapy</span></strong><span> in Feng Shui and their potential impact on headaches.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Spatial design and flow of Qi</span></strong></h3>\n<p><span>Interior </span><strong><span>design</span></strong><span> plays a central role in the practice of Feng Shui, and the goal is to promote life energy. A steady and harmonious flow of </span><strong><span>Qi</span></strong><span> can help promote overall well-being and possibly prevent headaches. The </span><strong><span>arrangement of furniture</span></strong><span> , the selection of beautiful </span><span>Feng Shui </span><strong><span>decorations</span></strong> <span>and the general organization of the room can influence you.</span></p>\n<p><span>The </span><strong><span>clarity and order</span></strong><span> in a room can help reduce </span><strong><span>stress</span></strong><span> and therefore the likelihood of headaches. A neat and clearly designed space allows for an unobstructed flow </span><strong><span>of Qi</span></strong><span> , creating a relaxing and supportive environment. It is also advisable to avoid </span><strong><span>blockages and clutter as these can inhibit the flow of energy and cause stress.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Another important consideration is the </span><strong><span>positioning</span></strong><span> of furniture and other objects in a room. Avoiding sharp edges and creating open spaces can also help. The </span><strong><span>direction</span></strong><span> in which furniture faces or is aligned is also important. Harmonious room design can help prevent headaches and create a calming environment.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://feng-shui.de/wp-content/uploads/feng-shui-beratung-fuer-innenraum-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"A bright living room with natural accents and a little girl reading a book on the sofa\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Color therapy and its potential effect on headaches</span></strong></h3>\n<p><strong><span>Colors</span></strong><span> have a special meaning in Feng Shui and can influence the energy of a room. They can alsoaffect</span><strong><span> emotions</span></strong><span> and</span><strong><span> overall well-being , providing a potential solution to </span></strong><strong><span>headache prevention</span></strong><span> .</span></p>\n<p><span>Choosing calming colors can have a relaxing effect and help create a stress-free environment.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Choosing calming colors can have a relaxing effect and help create a stress-free environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><span>For example, blue</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>green</span></strong><span> are colors associated with calm and healing. They can help create a relaxing and calming atmosphere, potentially reducing the frequency of headaches.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>On the other hand, bright colors</span></strong><span> such as intense red or orange can in some cases be perceived as stimulating or even annoying and therefore do not help relieve headaches.</span></p>\n<p><span>Using </span><strong><span>color therapy</span></strong><span> in Feng Shui is an individual journey. It is important to choose colors that give you a feeling of calm and balance. By experimenting with different colors and observing how they affect your mood and well-being, you can find a color palette that helps prevent headaches and creates a harmonious environment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Steps to optimize living and working areas</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>Optimizing spaces is a central element of Feng Shui and can help create a harmonious and healthy environment </span><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> Such an environment can, in turn, help relieve or prevent headaches and other ailments. Here are some concrete steps you can take to optimize chi flow in your living and work spaces:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span>Tidying up and decluttering:</span></strong><span> Start by clearing your rooms of clutter. Clutter can block and cause stress. A tidy, well-organized space allows for a free and harmonious flow of energy.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Furniture positioning:</span></strong><span> Position your furniture so that it supports you and doesn't block you. Avoid placing furniture directly in front of doors or in narrow passageways. The </span><strong><span>positioning of the furniture</span></strong><span> should also promote communication and interaction between people. A </span><span>Feng Shui children's room</span><span> in particular should be individually designed for your child in order to strengthen their health.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Using Plants:</span></strong><span> Live plants can help enliven the space and improve air quality. Choose plants with rounded leaves and avoid plants with pointed or spiky leaves, as these are considered negative energy.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Influence of colors:</span></strong><span> As already mentioned in color therapy, colors can influence the energy of a room. Use calming colors to create a relaxing and harmonious environment.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Use of mirrors: </span></strong><span>Mirrors</span><span> can visually enlarge rooms. However, place them so that they don't reflect sharp edges or unpleasant views.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Pay attention to good lighting:</span></strong><span> Good lighting is crucial for a positive energy flow. Use natural light sources wherever possible and complement them with warm artificial lighting to brighten dark corners.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Establish quiet zones:</span></strong><span> Create areas where you can </span><span>relax and unwind</span><span> . Quiet zones help to calm you down and offer you a place to relax.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Regular ventilation:</span></strong><span> Fresh air is important for your lungs and your vitality. Ventilate your rooms regularly to improve air quality and avoid stagnant energy.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span>Using Feng Shui Treatments</span></strong><span> : You can also use specific Feng Shui treatments such as crystals, water features, or wind chimes to optimize space and promote balance and harmony in your rooms. This often requires the professional expertise of a </span><span>Feng Shui consultant</span><span> .</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>By following these steps, you can make a big contribution to </span><strong><span>optimizing</span></strong><span> your living and working areas. Not only will this improve the quality of your environment, but it can also help reduce the frequency and severity of headaches by creating a supportive and relaxing environment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><span>Other natural methods for pain relief</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span>In addition to optimizing the flow of chi through Feng Shui, there are other </span><strong><span>natural methods</span></strong><span> that can help </span><strong><span>relieve pain</span></strong><span> .

Through regular meditation, you can learn to better deal with stress, which can be a major cause of tension headaches. Meditation can also help you develop a deeper awareness of your body's signals and thus respond better to pain.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Yoga</span></strong><span> is another complementary method that involves both the body and the mind. Combining physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation can help relieve muscle tension, improve flexibility, and promote an overall sense of well-being.
