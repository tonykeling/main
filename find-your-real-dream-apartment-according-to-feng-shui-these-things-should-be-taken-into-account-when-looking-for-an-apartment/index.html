u-inner"><p><span>The </span><span>rental apartment</span><span> market is currently very competitive. This can be attributed primarily to the high building interest rates. This has caused many people to abandon their plan to own their own home and continue to rent.</span></p><p><span>In many places, the demand for apartments exceeds the existing supply. The situation is particularly tense in the country's popular cities and metropolitan areas. Those looking for a new rental property often have to make compromises.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, when looking for an apartment, it helps to consider some of the basics of Feng Shui. These significantly increase the chances of getting a real dream apartment. If the apartment meets certain requirements right from the start, the probability is much higher that you will really feel comfortable in it and can benefit from the positive energies.</span></p><p><span>The following article explains which Feng Shui principles play a role in the search for your dream apartment.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The floor plan</span></h2><p><span>The floor plan of an apartment can always be divided into a total of eight cardinal directions. These each come with a different energy quality. If a cardinal direction is missing, for example because it is an L-shaped apartment, the corresponding energies of the cardinal direction are not present. This means that you cannot benefit from them and no negative energy can come from them.</span></p><p><span>If the positive energies in an apartment are not shown to be complete, this can have a major impact on overall well-being. For example, a cardinal direction based on personal values ​​feeds the energy of making money. It can therefore be very disadvantageous if this area is not available in the potential new apartment.</span></p><p><span>Ideally, the apartment has a square or rectangular floor plan. To find such a property in the south of the country, the </span><span>real estate expert in Ingolstadt</span><span> is the right contact.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Arrangement of windows and entrance doors</span></h2><p><span>The positive energy, the Qi, always enters the interior through the front door. However, if there is a window directly opposite the entrance door, there is a risk that this positive energy will immediately leave the apartment through the window. It is not possible to keep the energy in the rooms. So this cannot be used for your own benefit. However, there are also remedies to keep the Qi and let it flow through the rooms.</span></p><p><span>The teaching of temporal Feng Shui also assumes that the majority of energy occurs in the area where the apartment opens. However, this area does not necessarily have to be the entrance door. It can also be the side of the apartment where there are a lot of </span><span>windows and a spacious patio door.</span></p><p><span>The front door often leads into a rather dark hallway. This is generally avoided by the Qi, as this area of ​​the home is hardly particularly inviting for positive energy.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Arrangement of entrance door and bathroom</span></h2><p><span>However, it's not just the arrangement of the entrance door and windows that matters, but also the placement of the </span><span>bathroom</span><span> .</span></p><p><span>The positive energy would also quickly disappear in the toilet or bathroom. Those who do not want to do without Qi in their own four walls should therefore make sure that the bathroom is not located directly below the entrance door.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The center of the apartment</span></h2><p><span>In Feng Shui, the center of the apartment is called Tai Qi. This is an important collection point for energy. Above all, the prevailing basic energies are concentrated in the center of the apartment.</span></p><p><span>For this reason, it is very important that the center of the apartment is always freely accessible and walkable. In order to determine exactly where the Tai Qi is located in the respective apartment, a line must be drawn from the bottom right to the top left in the floor plan. An additional line is then drawn from the bottom left to the top right. The center of the apartment is at the point where the two lines meet.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The incidence of light</span></h2><p><span>If the potential new apartment is only provided with a small amount of natural </span><span>light</span><span> , Feng Shui usually suffers. A sufficiently bright apartment is important, otherwise the energy will quickly find another place.</span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>The house entrance</span></h2><p><span>The entrance area to the apartment plays an essential role when it comes to the positive energies in the rooms. In this case, it is very important that there is </span><span>order</span><span> . Feng Shui followers will already be familiar with the phrase that energy always follows attention.</span></p><p><span>For example, if the garbage cans are left open in front of the entrance to the house, the flowers in the front garden are dry and the paving slabs are damaged, this is hardly attractive for the energy. A messy entrance to the house can prevent energy from finding its way into the apartment.</span></p><p><span>Nobody wants to live in a house without energy. That's why the entrance to the house should also be given the necessary attention when viewing.</span></p><p><span>When it comes to the entrance to the house, there is something else to consider in addition to the basic order and first impression. In some houses the entrance is not visible at first glance. So you have to look for this for a long time. However, this also confuses the Qi to a great extent - the energy cannot orient itself this way.</span></p><p><span>In order to direct the Qi into the apartment, it is important that the doorbell signs are clearly labeled and there is sufficient lighting in the entrance area. The house number should also be easy to recognize.</span></p><p><span id="elementor-toc__heading-anchor-6" class="elementor-menu-anchor"></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span>These things are important before moving</span></h2><p><span>It's not just poorly ventilated rooms and dark corners that attract negative energy, Sha Qi. The same applies to rooms that are too crowded or untidy. Once you have finally found your new dream apartment, you should definitely take advantage of the opportunity and clean it out properly. Although this may involve a certain amount of effort, it is still worth it.</span></p><p><span>If the new apartment does not comply with the Feng Shui principles in all respects, this is no reason to despair. There are still numerous measures that can be taken to optimize the energy flow in the new home. This includes, for example, a careful selection of colors for the walls.</span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on May 3, 2024</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/authors/zuppasoupid/" title="zuppasoup.id">zuppasoup.id</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/renovation-work-according-to-feng-shui-how-can-you-finance-it/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/8/responsive/shell-367402_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?" height="420" width="640"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Feng Shui in the wardrobe</h5></div><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/6/responsive/ai-generated-8111336_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Feng Shui in the wardrobe" height="437" width="640"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/renovation-work-according-to-feng-shui-how-can-you-finance-it/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/8/responsive/shell-367402_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="420" width="640" alt="Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/renovation-work-according-to-feng-shui-how-can-you-finance-it/" class="inverse">Renovation work according to Feng Shui: How can you finance it?</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-27T13:00" class="u-small">April 27, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/6/responsive/ai-generated-8111336_640-xs.webp" loading="lazy" height="437" width="640" alt="Feng Shui in the wardrobe"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/feng-shui-in-the-wardrobe/" class="inverse">Feng Shui in the wardrobe</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-29T13:00" class="u-small">April 29, 2024</time></figcaption></figure><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui-ways-to-create-positive-energy-in-your-home/" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://www.zuppasoup.id/media/posts/5/responsive/Feng-Shui-Wandgestaltung-2-1024x683-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt="Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home"></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://www.zuppasoup.id/wall-design-according-to-feng-shui-ways-to-create-positive-energy-in-your-home/" class="inverse">Wall design according to Feng Shui Ways to create positive energy in your home</a></h4><time datetime="2024-04-30T13:00" class="u-small">April 30, 2024</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments-area box"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="cusdis_thread" data-host="https://cusdis.com" data-app-id="7d9e3fa0-2cd4-487d-8077-b8ab59b20879" data-page-id="7" data-page-url="https://www.zuppasoup.id/find-your-real-dream-apartment-according-to-feng-shui-these-things-should-be-taken-into-account-when-looking-for-an-apartment/" data-page-title="Find your real dream apartment: According to Feng Shui, these things should be taken into account when looking for an apartment" data-theme="auto"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var cusdis_element_to_check = document.getElementById('cusdis_thread');
